Blackbeard's abilities and loadout make him a very versatile pick that holds great offensive capabilities. In this patch we would like to keep his versatility while slightly reducing his offensive capabilities.\n\nThe first group of changes attend to Blackbeard's Aim Down Sight (ADS) mechanics. He will be slower to leave ADS, making him more vulnerable in that state. He also won't be able to ADS while rappelling in through a window.\n\nThe second group of changes are related to Blackbeard's Weapon Reloads. Now the H.U.L.L Shield will fold completely during the reloads, exposing most of Blackbeard's body to the enemies. The MK-17 will also see its magazine capacity reduced from 25 to 20. This should make Blackbeard reload more often and with higher risk.\n\nThe third group of changes aim to make Blackbeard a bit slower. While on rappel he won't be able to Breach In through non-weakened barricades, and we've also reduced his H.U.L.L Shield Breach Charges to from 4 to 3.\n\n### H.U.L.L. ADAPTABLE SHIELD\n\n- ADS Changes\n  - Blackbeard ADS recovery time set to 0.9s (was 0.5s).\n  - Blackbeard can't ADS while rappelling in a window.\n- Reload Changes\n  - Blackbeard's H.U.L.L. Shield completely folds while reloading.\n- Mobility Changes\n  - Blackbeard cannot breach-in from rappel through non-weakened barricades.\n  - H.U.L.L. Shield Breach Charges reduced to 3 (was 4).\n\n## ECHO\n\nEcho is losing the Magnified Sight on his MP5SD; he will no be more inclined to take fights at closer range and we ant to boost his mobility to make repositioning easier for him.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Speed:__ Increased to 2 (from 1).\n- __Health:__ Reduced to 2 (from 3).\n\n## FENRIR\n\nFenrir's ability has a high impact on Attackers. Since the last changes we made to him, it is easier to counter his traps, but we still consider his ability to be quite strong. We want to make the full Fenrir package a bit leaner by removing some of the extra utility that the Bailiff brings to the table. Players will need to rely on other defenders to set up the site.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Removed Bailiff 410.\n\n## LESION\n\nLesion has become one of the most reliable roamers. The combination of a great loadout, plus an ability that is useful for gathering intel and slowing enemies makes him a great option. The removal of the Magnified Sights on some Operators will make him more relevant. We are removing Lesion's shotgun to increase Lesion's focus on his ability, inviting Defenders to source destruction capabilities on the team from other loadouts.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Removed Super Shorty.\n\n## ORYX\n\nOryx's playstyle relies on mobility and quick reactions. A machine pistol provides high firepower and a quicker ADS compared to a submachine gun, allowing him to stay agile and effective in mid-range engagements. However, he will need to make more strategic decisions based on the situation, as selecting the Reaper MK2 without the SPAS-12 will leave him without the tools to destroy hatches. We believe that this addition will make him more adaptable and capable of handling a variety of combat situations while increasing the loadout variety.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## PULSE\n\nPulse greatly benefits from using the M1014, but the lack of a reliable secondary weapon limits its use in various situations. Since the recent improvements to shotguns, which significantly reduced the M1014's visual recoil for better comfort, its pick rate has stabilized at 29%. However, we believe that this rate is still below its potential, given its synergy with the Cardiac Sensor.\n\nBy introducing the Reaper MK2, we aim to provide Pulse with greater flexibility and ensure he doesn't feel powerless when opting to use the shotgun. Additionally, we believe that every weapon in his loadout has its own playstyle and fulfills different needs. The UMP45 will remain the most reliable option for long to mid-range engagements, while the M1014 and Reaper MK2 combination may be more appealing to mid to close-range play. And, of course, the handguns are always a reliable choice in any situation.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## ROOK\n\nRook's capability to hold long angles will be reduced due to the removal of Magnified Sights from his loadout. To reinforce his anchor role, we would like to add an alternative side weapon and gadget: the Reaper MK2 and C4. Both elements should reinforce his strength on close and mid-range engagements.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n- __Gadgets:__ Removed Observation Blocker. Added Nitro Cell.\n\n## SENTRY\n\nSentry is designed to fill any gaps in the defensive setup. However, with the current loadout he struggles to hold long angles comfortably. Therefore, we have decided to add a Slug Shotgun to his loadout. This addition will enhance his capability in long-range engagements while assisting with site setup.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary Weapon:__ Added TCSG12.\n\n## SLEDGE\n\nThe Reaper MK2 is less lethal than other Machine Pistols in the game, and that makes it suitable for a wider group of Operators. The addition of the Reaper MK2 will give Sledge a secondary weapon alternative that works good at close ranges.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## STRIKER\n\nWe believe that Striker also deserves a weapon more suited for long-range engagements. The DMR will enable her to better support her teammates from a distance, and may synergize more effectively with other types of secondary utility.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary Weapon:__ Added SR-25.\n\n## WAMAI\n\nWe've removed a few secondary destruction tools in this patch (Lesion's and Fenrir's), but we don't want to affect the overall destruction capability of defenders too much. For this reason, Wamai will receive the Super Shorty, which will improve his usefulness during the preparation phase.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Super Shorty.\n\n## YING\n\nThe SIX12 is highly effective at close range but is not reliable at medium to long distances. The Reaper MK2 will provide a versatile secondary option, allowing her to engage enemies effectively at various ranges and creating more opportunities to use the shotgun in close-quarters combat. She can also use the shotgun for breaching and verticality, creating more opportunities to use the Candelas from above or from unexpected angles.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n## DEPLOYABLE SHIELD\n\nThis change is a small quality of life improvement. In some situations, a direct source of light generates a strong glare on the shield glass windows that prevents a clear view through them. We've improved the glass materials to ensure that the glass pieces do not generate glare in these situations.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Glass:__ Light reflections reduced for better comfort\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Echo\n- Ela\n- Frost\n- Pulse\n- Sentry\n- Tachanka\n- Thorn\n- Thunderbird\n- Warden\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n## SIGHTS\n\nMagnified Sights on Defensive Operators has a huge impact on their presence and on their killing potential. This update will limit defenders' access to these sights on automatic weapons. We still believe that defenders should be able to hold long angles and challenge attackers, but in a more limited way. Slug Shotguns and DMRs will still have access to Magnified Sights on Defense.\n\nAlso in this patch, you will find that some of the affected Operators have received tweaks to compensate for these changes, but more may come in the future. We will keep a close eye on the effect of these changes and will take action if needed.\n\n### MAGNIFIED\n\n- Automatic weapons on Defense do not have access to these scopes.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Castle\n- Doc\n- Echo\n- Frost\n- Goyo\n- Rook\n- Tachanka\n\n## BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\nShielded Operators will experience a slight exposure when throwing a projectile from behind the shield. Although this opening is smaller than it was with original shields, the momentary exposure creates a vulnerability that defenders can exploit, making it riskier for shielded operators to throw projectiles.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Projectile Throw:__ Animation added.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blackbeard\n- Blitz\n- Fuze\n- Montagne\n\n## MK17 CQB\n\nAs part of Blackbeard's balancing wave, we are tweaking his most used weapon. We are reducing its magazine capacity to make players more thoughtful when shooting. This should reduce the use of long pre-fires and make Blackbeard reload more often.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Magazine:__ Reduced to 20 (was 25)\n- __Max Ammunition:__ Reduced to 221 (was 226)\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blackbeard\n\n## REAPER MK2\n\nThe Reaper is being issued to a few more Operators, and we want to take this opportunity to make its recoil a bit more comfortable. This weapon aims to be a bit different to other Machine Pistols in the game, and we want to keep that spirit. The initial rounds of the shot will be easier to handle, but sustained bursts will remain challenging to control. Using the weapon in short bursts will be more rewarding and successful for players.\n\n### RECOIL - PC\n\n- __First Shot:__ Reduced weapon initial kick.\n- __Horizontal:__ Softened lateral recoil on first stages.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Oryx\n- Pulse\n- Rauora\n- Rook\n- Sledge\n- Ying\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n![[R6S] Y10S3 Designer's Notes Y10S2 Rank Distribution PC](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1Nkufc8i5QrgzsInIJuxJb/54fd331e50e890d6a49604d407fafcad/Y10S2_Rank_Distribution_PC.png)\n\n![[R6S] Y10S3 Designer's Notes Y10S2 Rank Distribution Console](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2nATjELyMG7JkObhN6jA0I/3a63939ece6790e8b6cabb3f6bd153b4/Y10S2_Rank_Distribution_Console.png)\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/4czc3hlHtXrd27crELGDcc/y10s3-designers-notes","date":"2025-08-18T01:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"KrNWbNKmJiL1uXbCXy6ig","title":"Watch The Y10S3 Reveal, Get A Weapon Charm On Twitch!","abstract":"Tune into the upcoming Season Reveal Panel on Sunday, August 17 and earn an exclusive Weapon Charm!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/74dmnVGaxF739nU52HVdP3/2c1bf2a50a60610da7cfebf5a069c918/Y10S3Drop.jpeg","content":"This weekend, we'll pull back the curtain on what's coming next season in the Y10S3 Reveal Panel, and you can earn an exclusive weapon charm by watching live on Twitch!\n\nWe'll have Twitch Drops active on the official Rainbow Six Twitch channels and select partner streams for two hours once the Season Reveal Panel begins, so be sure to tune in to claim the *Y10S3 REVEAL CHARM for free!*\n\nThis offer will be live on August 17 from 10AM Pacific Time / 1PM Eastern Time until 12PM Pacific Time / 3PM Eastern Time.

Today we'll look at the status since the release of Siege X and R6 ShieldGuard, and cover what's coming in the future. Check out the team's plans below.\n\n## STATUS OVERVIEW\n\nSince the launch of Siege X, it's clear that there has been a surge in cheater reports. The share of matches featuring players who receive 4 or more cheater reports within that single game has risen from an average of 1.8% to 2.5%. This spike is tied to the evolution of in-game exploits and the ongoing development of cheat programs. We know the impact that this has had on the enjoyment of the game for many and we are very actively working on solutions.\n\nWe've deployed several fixes since launch, though some of the improvements needed to strengthen R6 ShieldGuard will require longer-term development. Our goal is to make meaningful progress throughout Season 3 and beyond, ensuring we protect the game's integrity and improve your overall experience.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - impact](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2syXTDSCsyA9sPhJyEWJrr/130c22ca28af5a36504e18515d4c091d/R6_CheaterReportChart_Y10S2-960x540.jpg)\n\n## EXPLOITS\n\nWith the release of Siege X and the increased number of players, bugs were found in the game that could be used to gain an unfair advantage over other teams and players. These exploits are also a form of cheating.\n\nWith the help of our community, we've been able to address several major exploits as part of our most recent patches,including multiple teleportation glitches, legitimate external overlay applications providing an unfair visual advantage, impossible defusing spots or impossible use of weapons and gadgets, and crashes caused by specific operators. We have also identified and are actively fixing additional issues, with updates rolling out as soon as they're ready.\n\nWe want to sincerely thank everyone who has contributed - content creators, players, and those who have submitted reports via R6Fix. Your input has been crucial in helping us reproduce and resolve many of these exploits. To further prevent new exploits, we're working on a global solution that includes stricter tolerances in given situations to prevent similar exploits. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n## R6 SHIELDGUARD SECURITY\n\nThroughout Operation Daybreak, we have deployed several updates to our underlying in-house obfuscation technology which hides and protects game code. These updates are strengthening our defenses, and while we're already seeing some positive trends, more updates will be coming with every patch and hotfix. We're also constantly investing in reducing and stopping new gameplay violations, while improving our detections, targeting specific cheat features and providers.\n\n## LIVE SECURITY UPDATES\n\nYou may have noticed that Siege X occasionally requires a game restart and update. This is part of a new prevention system which has strengthened our anti-cheat defenses overall. While the system has been effective, we've identified bugs that have caused some players to be disconnected from matches or unable to reconnect. We understand how frustrating this can be and sincerely apologize for the disruption. Our team is actively working to resolve these issues so that players can benefit from enhanced protection without any unintended side effects.\n\n## ACCOUNT RELATED BANS\n\nWe're actively developing new tools that detect accounts linked to previously banned cheaters. If a banned player attempts to return, they're flagged and removed as soon as suspicious behavior is detected. In addition, we're working on systems to hold players accountable if they knowingly squad up with cheaters. This is part of our broader effort to protect the integrity of the game at every level.\n\n## PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 SHIELDGUARD\n\nCheck out the last 12 months of perma-ban data, including new data for April to July. We can see here that the number of monthly bans has remained steady since the launch of Operation Prep Phase, with over 11,000 permanent bans issued on average per month. With a rise in cheaters being felt during the month of July however, investigation were started into whether our systems were still banning with the same effectiveness as previous months. This investigation led to adjustments being made to R6 ShieldGuard, which resulted in an additional ban wave being completed in early August.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - battleye](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6Z47X7rE81nx97K6phvWy1/ce0996775fe6dbfc6af849c320dd390b/R6_BanChart_Aug24-July25_Y10S2.jpg)\n\n## HOW YOU CAN HELP\n\n### ACTIVATE TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATION\n\nKeeping your account secure helps keep the game fair for everyone. That's why we strongly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), especially using a mobile authenticator app if possible. By turning on 2FA, you're not just protecting your progress, you're helping us to fight cheating and keep the community safe. For more information on 2FA, check our [self-help article](https://www.ubisoft.com/help/account/article/000065723).\n\n### REPORTING\n\nIn-game reporting continues to be the best way to get your reports to us, helping us to identify potential cheaters and take action.\n\nYour in-game reports help by:\n- Feeding our automated systems while combining with additional information.\n- Aiding the manual review process allowing cross reference for specific actions.\n- Providing an understanding of player perception on the current state of cheating at a global scale.\n\n## FINAL NOTE\n\nProtecting the game from cheaters and exploit abusers remains one of our top priorities.\n\nThroughout July, the team has consistently delivered fixes and improvements. In order to release stable solutions, some of the fixes may take more time, but our commitment to act quickly and effectively when issues arise continues. Elements of our future R6 ShieldGuard updates are also already underway, with more to be revealed soon.\n\nWe're not slowing down. Our focus is clear: keep Siege X fair, secure, and fun for everyone.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - toxicity](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/31p8jP1TStXmSZQRF5Dxkg/320bafee070f50e70d249b6b4cd45151/Header_AntiToxicity_150x960_Y10S2.png)\n\nThe Anti-Toxicity team is here to share a look at how the Reputation System has been performing in the time since its full rollout. Right now, the system is helping to shape a healthier, more respectful Siege experience and in this update, we'll share highlights on key features, ongoing improvements, and what's next.\n\n## REPUTATION SYSTEM\n\n### STANDING DISTRIBUTION UPDATE\n\nThe Reputation System was released from Beta in Y10S1, and this means that we now have more data than ever on its impact on players. Since its full activation, the amount of Dishonorable and Disruptive players has dropped by 81% and 54% respectively. Conversely, the number of players in Exemplary has increased by 114% with Esteemed increasing by 45%. It's clear that players have been adapting their behavior and rising to higher Reputation Standings, in turn making the game better for everyone.\n\n__STANDINGS - Y9S4 to Y10S2__\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - standings](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5rokWTq6MOOarbm4vqhr7Q/599fe0fe1e420ca92a31543d81f308f2/R6_AllStandings_Y9S4-Y10S2_Vert.v3.jpg)\n\n### DISRUPTIVE COMMUNICATION\n\nOur Anti-Toxicity systems are scaling with Siege X and continue to protect players from disruptive behaviors. We are now seeing a reduction of communication reports per match, with a -14% for Textchat and -27% for Voice Chat. This is also partly thanks to the new Chat Wheel, which allows players to communicate quickly and easily without friction. We can see below that exposure to negative actions dropped significantly with the release of Siege X.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - communication](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7m8OTw1bC8NwRuwmbGKoFw/10296dbf88be4a694b180987b4acd53d/R6_FlagExposure.jpg)\n\n### REPUTATION SYSTEM SANCTIONS\n\nSince March 2025, we have temporarily banned over 4600 players who had completed an excessive amount of negative actions, accruing a critical number of negative Reputation Units. We can share that these temporary bans have worked well however, with 3 of 5 players adapting their behavior and not going on to offend again\n\n### DUAL FRONT ACTIVATION\n\nThe Reputation System is now active in Dual Front and positive and negative actions completed in this mode now impact your Reputation. Dual Front initially released without integration into the Reputation System, though thanks to your feedback, we were able to adapt our plans and bring the activation forward.\n\n## COMMUNICATION MODERATION\n\n### TEXTCHAT\n\nTextchat Moderation went live in December 2024, and since then we've worked to ensure the feature evolved with player feedback. The system is now working well, though we are aware that false detections can sometimes occur, often due to lack of context in a conversation.\n\nFrom Y10S3 we will be implementing functionality which will enable players with a Reputation Standing of Respectable and above to report detections which they believe to be incorrectly flagged. This, as well as our ongoing behind-the-scenes updates, will help to fine tune the system, reducing the chances of your messages being falsely flagged.\n\n### VOICE CHAT\n\nIn Y10S3 we will be introducing the next step of chat moderation in Siege in the form of Voice Chat moderation. With this addition, players flagged by the system will receive a warning and be subsequently muted if flagged again. In more extreme cases, offenders may find themselves being muted immediately and without warning. In all cases, any flags will carry a Reputation Standing impact, though as with Textchat, players with a positive standing will be able to report false voice communication flags.\n\nWe'll be utilising our experience with the Text Chat Moderation feature to bring balance to this new system. And, as we did with Text Chat Moderation, we'll be giving this feature close attention, ensuring that any false flags can be learned from with changes made to the system quickly.\n\n## ABANDONMENT PENALTIES\n\nAbandonment penalties, although necessary, can be a source of great frustration for those who receive them unfairly. This season we've already lessened the length of penalties, though there is more to come. We are actively working to implement a system that will target repetitive patterns over a longer period and subsequently enable us to reduce frustration for others.\n\n## PRIVACY SETTINGS\n\nPrivacy Mode is making its way to console in Y10S3. With this release, we'll be making some important updates to Privacy Mode across all platforms. Starting next season, nicknames will be auto assigned, removing the possibility of bad actors creating toxic usernames.All players will also have their nicknames removed at the end of a match, revealing their true usernames.\n\n## FINAL NOTE\n\nWe are very proud of the evolution that we’ve made with your feedback, together fostering a more positive environment. The Reputation System is working well in Siege X, helping to protect new and current players. We are devoted to our goal of making Siege a fun and safe game for everyone, and our work will continue through Y10S3 and beyond.\n\nYour feedback and support will always be key. Stay positive and let’s continue to make the game better!  \n\n---\n\n## OPERATION HIGH STAKES FULL REVEAL\n\nStay tuned for the *Operation High Stakes* full reveal, happening on __Sunday, August 17th at 10AM PT / 1PM ET / 7PM CET__ on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/)and[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6).\n\nWe'll also share __additional updates__ on the __R6 ShieldGuard & Anti-Toxicity__ systems, giving you a first look at __what's coming in the new season,__ so don't miss it!","categories":["anti-cheat","toxicity"],"readTime":10,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1JLAM9uc3HwK5N04IgR5pI/r6-shieldguard-antitoxicity-y10s2-update","date":"2025-08-14T02:55:00.000Z"},{"id":"W9uJP8bTZDjfuKt6r7aWn","title":"Y10S2 MID-SEASON ROADMAP UPDATE","abstract":"Check out what's coming to Siege X in the Y10S2 Mid-Season Roadmap Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1hXqxoBQAqRz6Gfc2klIcV/627dc503512f614c8f879a905e9f0103/R6_Y10S2_RoadmapHeader.960x540.jpg","content":"In our latest roadmap update, we've got further insights into the development of upcoming features, ensuring transparent communication with all players.

With this, an anonymous username will be generated automatically, helping protect your identity during matches.\n\n### [ANTI-TOXICITY] ABANDONMENT PENALTY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n- __Status: Delayed to Y10S4__\n\nReceiving an abandonment penalty due to a game crash or disconnection can be frustrating, and to this end our team is developing solutions to ensure that where possible, unfair penalties are cancelled.\n\n### [ANTI-TOXICITY] ADDITIONAL REPUTATION SYSTEM ACTION DETECTIONS\n\n- __Status: Delayed to Y10S4__\n\nThe Reputation System will be updated to increase the amount of actions that can be detected and evaluated when calculating Reputation Standings.

One of our concerns with Blackbeard on release was to deliver a Shield Operator with good offensive capabilities but without being the deadliest Operator in town. After the remaster, Blackbeard's Kill Death Ratio has dropped around 25% to 0.9. This makes him sit slightly higher than Blitz at 0.8, meaning both shield Operators sit in the low bracket for Attackers' K/D.\n\nAnother important metric to consider is his impact in the team's success and compositions. He is a popular operator, but is average when it comes to win rate. His ban rate has been rising since release, being higher on PC than on Console.\n\nWe are not releasing any substantial change for Blackbeard this season, but we will update his shield with some quality of life changes. This decision is based on the shared data analysis and the fact that a new Ban System is releasing this season; we want to see how his ban rate adapts to the new system before we take any action.\n\nIn this update we've added a tinted layer to the outside of the glass that should help Blackbeard's enemies to read faster and from farther if he is aiming down sight or not. We've also improved the glass movement audio to make it easier to hear if Blackbeard is aiming down sight or not.\n\nWe will keep a close eye on Blackbeard's performance and his adaptation to the new Ban System and prepare future changes if needed.\n\n### H.U.L.L. ADAPTABLE SHIELD\n\n- Added tint to outside glass\n- Made improvements to glass audio\n\n## CLASH\n\nClash's shield and taser combination can be quite frustrating to play against. Her ability to damage enemies while being heavily protected makes her difficult to challenge, especially since the taser also slows you down and the main counter is at melee range. Additionally, playing as Clash is not particularly engaging for many players, as her current mechanics do not offer a satisfying or interesting gaming experience.\n\nWe have focused on three main pillars with this update:\n\n- __Enhanced Movement__: We are giving her more freedom of movement with her shield. She won't require any special site setup to move around while still being protected. The shield will dynamically adapt to her needs, making her more versatile and agile.\n\n- __Shield as a Gadget__: Clash will be able to anchor her shield on the ground, allowing her to play around it without needing to rely on allies. This change provides her with more independence and flexibility in positioning. She can still use the taser against enemies facing the deployed shield, so she can slow down enemies on one side while managing another angle or capitalizing on the effect by herself. This adds a strategic layer, enabling her to control multiple areas simultaneously and offer support to her team without having to be in the frontline.\n\n- __Fairness__: The taser will no longer deal damage, ensuring that Clash cannot kill an enemy while being fully protected by the shield. This aligns her more closely with other Ballistic Shields, maintaining the principle that you cannot be lethal if you cannot receive lethal damage. The intensity of the slowdown effect will also vary based on the enemy's movement direction. Enemies running away from Clash will experience less slowdown, preventing Clash from punishing attackers that don't want to face her.\n\nOverall, these adjustments will make Clash a more engaging and interactive operator, enhancing her role as a versatile support player who can control key areas and disrupt enemy strategies. We believe the new Clash will be more enjoyable to play, both as and against her.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Movement:__ Can sprint, crouch, vault, and dash through barricades, but the shield will collapse automatically while performing those actions.\n\n- __Free Look:__ Is available while having the shield equipped.\n\n### CCE SHIELD MK2\n\n- __Deploy:__ The CCE Shield MK2 can be deployed. Can be picked up again.\n\n- __Vulnerabilities when deployed:__\n  - The shield can be destroyed with explosives.\n  - Anyone can bash through the shield to destroy it.\n  - The Taser Battery can be destroyed by a Kludge Drone. The shield will stay intact, but the Taser cannot be used anymore.\n\n### TASER\n\n- __Activation:__ Can be toggled on and off using the Switch Ability Button. When the shield is not equipped Clash will use a Remote Controller to do so.\n\n- __Electricity:__ Doesn't deal damage.\n\n- __Slowdown:__ The intensity depends on the movement direction (stronger towards Clash).\n\n- __Battery:__ Increased to 10 seconds (from 5).\n\n- __Area:__ Wider area of effect (Changed from a box to a cone).\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Gadgets:__ Removed Deployable Shield.\n\n## SLEDGE\n\nSledge will be able to disrupt enemies equipped with a Ballistic Shield by knocking them back with his Hammer. This will remove their protection and expose them, providing an opportunity for him or his teammates to take them down.\n\nHe will become a real menace for Clash, as he can use the Impact EMP Grenade to shut down her taser, allowing him to close the gap faster and hit her with the Hammer.\n\n### BREACHING HAMMER\n\n- __Ballistic Shields:__ Hitting a Ballistic Shield will knock back the operator.\n\n## JACKAL\n\nWe believe that the most frustrating aspect of Jackal's ability is the time he can keep you pinged with relatively low effort. Scanning a hottest/red set of footprints, even though sometimes dangerous, allows him to track the enemy for almost half a minute without putting in any additional effort or being in any kind of danger. To address this issue, we have decided to reduce the outcome of a scan to always result in a single ping. This means that scanning a set of footprints will give you the precise position of the enemy, but it will last as long as a regular red ping. Keep in mind that the scanned set will be erased when the scan is completed, so Jackal will be trading precise location for the ability to actively track the target until he reaches its last known location.\n\nHowever, we want to enhance his ability to actively track targets, as we believe this is his real strength and the one that better balances the risk and reward. Therefore, we have increased the duration of the coldest/blue footprints. These prints will now be between 60-120 seconds old, so they do not provide a lot of information but will help him to get on track faster. Remember that footprints are not generated during the Preparation Phase, so defenders are free to move around and prepare the site for the assault without being punished. Even if a defender is late returning to the site and gets scanned, they will only get pinged once, and all their footprints will be deleted from the map.\n\nWe will monitor this change very closely and make adjustments if needed.\n\n### EYENOX MODEL III\n\n- __Resources:__ Increased to 5 (from 3).\n\n### HUNTER MARK\n\n- __Pings:__ Reduced to always 1 (from 2-5).\n\n- __Debuff:__ Removed.\n\n### FOOTPRINTS\n\n- __Coldest (blue):__ Duration increased to 120 seconds (from 90).\n\n## JAGER\n\nBoth Jager and Wamai serve the same role in denying projectiles, but their different methods should ideally compliment various strategies and playstyles. Feeling forced to choose one over the other based on the specific projectiles you expect to face, rather than on your overall strategy, doesn't seem correct. Therefore, we are normalizing the list of interactions so that both detect the same projectiles.\n\nFurthermore, this rule made the game more complicated to understand for newcomers, as they needed to learn specific interactions between operators instead of a generic rule. This approach is more sustainable in the long run and makes the game more user-friendly.\n\n### ACTIVE DEFENSE SYSTEM\n\n- Capitao's Incendiary and Micro Smoke Bolts are detected and destroyed.\n\n- Gridlock's Trax Stingers are detected and destroyed.\n\n## THUNDERBIRD\n\nDespite the recent enhancements to the Kóna Stations, the potential risk of enemies exploiting them outweighs the benefits they provide, limiting their viable placements and situations where they should be most helpful. Therefore, the Kóna Station will no longer target enemies.\n\n### KONA STATION\n\n- __Targeting system:__ Only heals allies.\n\n## BRAVA\n\nDue to the new changes to Thunderbird, the Kludge Drone will no longer overheat a Kóna Station. Instead, its alliance will shift to target attackers rather than defenders, making it a valuable asset to your team.\n\n### KLUDGE DRONE\n\n- __Kóna Station:__ Hacking it changes the alliance (instead of overheating).\n\n## ELA\n\nThere was a mismatch between the detection area and the area of effect of Ela's Grzmot Mine, which could lead to confusion during gameplay. The area displayed when deploying the mine was smaller than its actual effect. This discrepancy could cause Ela to mistakenly believe she had the advantage when someone triggered the mine, only to find herself affected along with her victim. By aligning both values, we aim to enable Ela to better leverage her positioning around the mines and avoid unintended consequences.\n\nWe have decided to reduce the concussion range instead of increasing the area of detection because Ela is currently placing them according to the detection area, which seems sufficient to fulfill her playstyle. Doing it the other way around would be detrimental for her, as the Scorpion EVO 3 A1 and the FO-12 are both more effective in short-range engagements.\n\n### GRZMOT MINE\n\n- __Concussion range:__ Reduced to 4 meters (from 7).\n\n## ZOFIA\n\nSimilar to Ela, there was a discrepancy between the detection area and the area of effect. Although the issue is not identical, we have decided to normalize it as well. This adjustment ensures that the Concussion Grenade is more accurate and affects the intended target rather than everyone in the room. This change addresses the discomfort among teammates, as any ally attempting to synchronize with Zofia to take down a target was most likely affected by the grenade as unintended collateral.\n\n### KS79 LIFELINE\n\n- __Concussion detection range:__ Reduced to 4 meters (from 5).\n\n- __Concussion range:__ Reduced to 4.25 meters (from 7).\n\n# SYSTEM BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## ELECTRICITY\n\nWith this update, we are making electricity a neutral element, ensuring that all gadgets and Operators in the match are vulnerable to electricity, regardless of their team alliance. This change is accompanied by improvements designed to make interactions with electricity clearer and more forgiving for players.\n\nElectricity will no longer cause damage to players. Instead, Operators will experience a reduction in movement speed. We have also reviewed how Operators get electrified. Now, Operators must intentionally interact with electrified gadgets to get zapped. Walking on electrified surfaces will electrify Operators, but merely being close to an electrified wall will not. Operators need to interact with the wall by deploying or vaulting it to become electrified.\n\nElectricity will still destroy Electronic gadgets, but Defender gadgets will no longer be invulnerable. This change requires Defenders to exercise more caution, especially when throwing gadgets through small holes on electrified reinforcements or operating moving drones like Echo's Yokai.\n\n### ELECTRICITY EFFECT\n\n- Damage to Operators removed from Electricity Effect.\n- Slowdown to Operators added to Electricity Effect.\n- Electricity is now neutral and affects equally every team.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Bandit\n- Kaid\n\n## LIMB DAMAGE\n\nBy reducing the damage to limbs, we aim to emphasize skillful gameplay. We encourage players to target more critical areas like the head or torso, which demands greater precision. This approach makes the gameplay more challenging and rewarding. Additionally, it enhances tactical depth, as players will need to carefully consider their positioning and aiming before taking the first shot to ensure a successful elimination. This change promotes more thoughtful and strategic gameplay, preventing players from being easily eliminated by a few shots to the arms or legs.\n\n### DAMAGE MODIFIERS\n\n- Reduced damage inflicted by Handguns:\n    - 50% by Small calibers (e.g. USP40).\n    - 50% by Medium caliber (e.g. M45 MEUSOC).\n    - 60% by High caliber (e.g.D-50).\n- Reduced to 60% the damage inflicted by Revolvers.\n- Reduced to 50% the damage inflicted by Machine Pistols.\n- Reduced damage inflicted by Submachine Guns:\n    - 50% by Small caliber (e.g. Mx4 Storm).\n    - 60% by Medium caliber (e.g. K1A).\n    - 65% by High caliber (e.g. UZK50GI).\n- Reduced damage inflicted by Assault Rifles:\n    - 50% by Small caliber (e.g. POF-9).\n    - 60% by Medium caliber (e.g. AUG A2).\n    - 65% by High caliber (e.g. Spear .308).\n- Reduced to 70% the damage inflicted by Light Machine Guns.\n- Reduced to 70% the damage inflicted by Designated Marksman Rifles.\n- Reduced to 70% the damage inflicted by Sniper Rifles.\n- Reduced to 70% the damage inflicted by Slug Shotguns.\n\nAll the values are down from 75%.\n\n## RAPPEL\n\nWe are removing the requirement of having a Breach Charge deployed on a window to execute a Rappel Breach. Allowing operators to use different tools like a Sledgehammer, shotguns, or explosives to destroy barricades while rappelling provides more tactical options and adaptability in high-pressure situations. This flexibility leads to more creative and dynamic gameplay, as players can choose the best tool for the situation. It enhances the immersion of the game, making the gameplay experience more engaging and intense.\n\nFurthermore, players can think strategically about their loadout and approach. Using a shotgun for a quick breach, a Sledgehammer for a silent entry, or a Breach Charge to ensure synchronization will significantly impact the outcome of engagements. This flexibility also enhances team coordination, as players can plan and synchronize their breaching strategy based on the tools available to them, promoting communication and teamwork.\n\n### RAPPEL BREACH\n\n- Operators can execute the Rappel Breach without needing to previously damage the barricade or place a Breach Charge.\n- The operator will go through the barricade if it is sufficiently damaged by the end of the interaction.\n    - Otherwise, the operator will bounce back and damage the barricade with its feet.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n## BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\nShielded operators will need to plan their paths more carefully, as they will no longer be able to aim down sights while vaulting over objects, through windows, or barricades. This adjustment will reduce their lethality when navigating through barricades, requiring them to rely on teammates to quickly capitalize on targets. We believe this change will encourage more strategic movement around the map and enhance the overall tactical experience.\n\n### BASE\n\n- Vault: Aiming down sight is canceled during the interaction.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blackbeard\n- Blitz\n- Fuze\n- Montagne\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n* * * * *\n\n![[R6S] Y10S2 Designer's Notes - Y10S1 Rank Distribution PC](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1NCSBxQZA7r04QpoXztQ9G/da19dea082365cffebd4a2d242b1d57e/Y10S1_Rank_Distribution_PC.jpg)\n\n![[R6S] Y10S2 Designer's Notes - Y10S1 Rank Distribution Console](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/qyKNPJn1077a6QWmJNmt2/30c5be46c0fccb133fba9d5c9e651657/Y10S1_Rank_Distribution_Console.jpg)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":14,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/8dJbwMqIt5Y8lZgwJRjWZ/y10s2-designers-notes","date":"2025-05-19T13:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"fUm14ptpr80MNeAOLWt0U","title":"R6 Credit Pack Changes Starting June 10","abstract":"We are adjusting the available in-game credit packs with the launch of Siege X.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3H3zq2ZMvvfFzFCgd6q7wp/8fe65fd41bb7b0e582ee8c0f7465191f/vc_960x540.png","content":"As part of our long-term commitment to Rainbow Six Siege, we're updating our R6 Credit packs on June 10 for the first time in nearly a decade.

This bundle has been designed in collaboration with artist Glambertiluvu and will be available for purchase in the in-game store for a limited time, starting May 8.\n\nWith this program, we want to celebrate our amazingly creative and dedicated community artists and give them the chance to have their art styles represented in-game. Each chosen artist will have the opportunity to design a full set for an operator of their choice and the resulting bundles will become available for limited time during Year 9 and beyond.\n\nThis season, the Community Artist Bundle not only supported a talented artist from our community, but proceeds will also benefit several content creators promoting the bundle as part of a new revenue-sharing test opportunity.\n\nGlambertiluvu's Iana Operator Bundle includes:\n\n- Uniform\n- Headgear\n- ARX200 weapon skin\n- Charm\n\nDon't forget to have a look at our previous bundles if you haven't yet: [SAU_SIEGE](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y6s1), [Sunstark](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y6s2), [FrAgMenT](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y6s3), [Pericote](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y6s4), [Shinosaaaaaaang](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y7s1), [Siege Tales](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y7s3), [Retrodisaster](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y7s4), [LevaSoj](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y8s1), and [Notamutemain](https://rainbow6.com/artistbundle_y8s2).\n\n## ABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nGlambertiluvu's - also known as RuL - interest for art started during her childhood as her parents were buying her art books and supplies. This led RuL to create doodles at a very young age, and even to draw on top of the illustrations in her school textbooks when growing up. Due to her obsession with visual arts and painting, she chose graphic design as her university major.\n\nIn 2021, RuL transitioned from semi-realism to a 2D cartoon art style using flat colors. This style is reflected in her bundle for Iana: from the design of the charm to the color palette used throughout the operator and weapon skin. Impressed by Iana's background and obsession for aerospace engineering, she chose to add different references to those in her bundle. Noticeably, the \"space buns\" hairstyle which is derived from the space-themed pop culture. Other starry details such as hair clips and face paint are found on Iana's skin. The most astute eyes will notice the graffiti on Iana's chest armor - \"Meijer\", her real last name.\n\nOriginally playing single-player games such as Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Glambertiluvu was drawn into Siege thanks to Lion's voice actor, Shawn Baichoo, who also interpreted Machiavelli in Assassin's Creed II and Wrench in Watch Dogs 2. She described being chosen to collaborate with the Rainbow Six Siege team on designing this bundle as the highlight of her career, bringing her joy and pride.\n\nAs a final word, we would like to quote RuL: \"I would like to express my gratitude to the R6S community for their passion. Creating this concept art was a labor of love, and I hope it resonates with players as much as it does with me. The community's engagement and enthusiasm inspire me to continue pushing creative boundaries, and I look forward to contributing more in the future.\"\n\nTo see more of Glambertiluvu's work, go check her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/glambertiluvu) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/glambertiluvu/) accounts.\n\n## FAQ\n\n__What is the Community Artist Bundle Program?__\n\nThe Community Artist Bundle Program launched in Y6S1 and it brings operator bundles created by some of our most talented and dedicated Siege fan artists into the game.\n\n__I'm a Siege fan artist too - what can I do to get selected as well?__\n\nGiven the length of our production cycle for in-game content, the fan artists for Year 10 have already been determined. However, we are always on the lookout for future participants. If your goal is to see your bundle in-game, continue showing us your passion and strive to be an outstanding member of the Siege community.\n\n__How can I get the Y10S2 Glambertiluvu Operator bundle?__\n\nThe bundle will be available in the in-game store for a limited time, starting May 8, and will remain live until the end of Y10S3. Players can purchase the bundle with R6 credits.\n\n__Will this offer be available on all platforms?__\n\nYes, it can be redeemed on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Amazon Luna.\n\n__How long will this offer be available?__\n\nFollowing its release on May 8, you have until the end of Y10S3 to purchase this bundle in the in-game store.\n","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","community"],"readTime":4,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3a6LfnM6paOsjQY6PDvfkC/community-artist-bundle-program-y10s2-glambertiluvu","date":"2025-05-08T16:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1N1qEcXvlvPG8z6EIa2MXx","title":"R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity – Y10S1 UPDATE","abstract":"Find our latest Anti-Cheat and Anti-Toxicity updates.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2yLNs78nz6j46SLMvWnlMV/baafcf146c8f32a2d3977302d120bf61/image-2025-05-02-14-30-15-848.jpg","content":"Today our R6 Shieldguard and Anti-Toxicity teams will be sharing their latest updates. We'll have a deep dive on features and results from Y10S1, as well as a look at some of the updates coming to the game in the future.\n\n## IN THIS UPDATE\n\n__R6 ShieldGuard__\n\n__ANTI-TOXICITY__\n\n- Standing Distribution\n\n- Impacts - Negative Actions Decreasing\n\n- Tuning & Additional Repercussions\n\n- Automated Textchat Moderation\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 Header ShieldGuard 150x960 Y10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/573Mkc8xNE3Jz4XPrrUqbV/845b361aff78777362faa96d0f1f07b8/Header_ShieldGuard_150x960_Y10S1.png)\n\n## STATUS OVERVIEW\n\nCheater reports have seen a downward trend throughout Y9S3, and this continued right up to the release of Y10S1.1. Since the Y10S1.1 update, we have seen an increase in cheater reports on PC. Thanks to your in-game cheater reports, our team has identified a correlation to some of our recent security updates.  Below we'll dive into  those updates and the action we're taking to turn this latest development around.\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 R6 CheaterReportChart 2024 Y10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/69Syc1J83T3IGUXWM60JJY/a37aa628e54b1e5fe8b23f98411c8a68/R6_CheaterReportChart_2024_Y10S1.jpg)\n\n## MAKING OUR CODE STRONGER - NEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn Y10S1 and in partnership with the security teams of Ubisoft, we introduced a hardening technology which enables new ways to secure our game code, making it more robust against cheat makers. This new technology now serves as a foundation for many other security improvements that will ship throughout the year.\n\n## WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING\n\nThe in-game impact of this technology was positive initially, though following Y10S1.1, we recorded an increase in cheater reports. We've seen that there is room for improvement, however this has only bolstered our commitment, and so we've worked to push new features throughout Y10S1, making the system more secure. Additionally, we've kept to our commitment to push security updates alongside patches, and so security hotfixes will continue leading up to and after the release of *Siege X*. Two additional security hotfixes are scheduled for deployment in May to further reinforce this approach.\n\n## FIGHTING LAG ABUSE TO PROTECT FAIR PLAY\n\nIn Y10S1, and with the help of the community, we fixed several exploits that were abusing network lag. We want to take the opportunity to heartfully thank the community, from content creators to everyone who submitted R6Fix reports. You have all helped us to both reproduce and fix many of these exploits that were possible on console. We're continuing to monitor the situation and to help prevent lag exploits on a wider basis, we are currently working on a global solution, using stricter network tolerations (More info to come soon).\n\n## PREVENTING MnK ON CONSOLE\n\nPreviously we shared that console cheater reports increased after the launch of Crossplay, and that we fixed an exploit that would allow spoofers to by-pass detection. We can now confirm that reports have seen a drop of approximately 20%. However, Console cheater reports are still higher than pre-crossplay  numbers and we are aware of anti-recoil cheats disrupting the community. Although our data shows that MouseTrap is performing well, catching spoofing devices such as Xim and Cronus, it currently lacks anti-recoil detection capabilities. We want to be clear, anti-recoil cheats are not acceptable, irrespective of platform. Although we cannot communicate on our roadmap at this time, rest assured that this is one of the R6 Shieldguard team's top priorities, and we are actively researching solutions. In the meantime, please continue to submit in-game reports.\n\n## SIEGE X & FUTURE PLANS\n\n__SECURITY UPDATES WITH EACH PATCH__\n\nWe will keep making our code stronger with *Siege X* and beyond. A security update will go live at launch, with more updates rolling out season after season specifically targeting the ability for cheats to stay online and disrupt the game.\n\n__R6 SHIELDGUARD UPDATES LIVE, NO MAINTENANCE REQUIRED__\n\nA major update to R6 Shieldguard will allow us to distribute new executables with updated security measures to players without the need for scheduled maintenance. Periodically, a security update will be downloaded, and players will be asked to reboot their game. Note that this will never happen during a match. After a reboot, players can continue playing, knowing that they are now on a newer executable with new security measures. This will make cheats more difficult to make and more costly to maintain, forcing cheats to stay offline longer.\n\n## SANCTIONS\n\nThanks to the new gameplay violations introduced in Y10S1, combined with automated data analysis and investigations from our team, we continued the momentum from the start of the year by issuing strong permanent ban waves in March, resulting in over 6,500 R6 Shieldguard perma-bans that month alone. On average since the beginning of the year, R6 Shieldguard has issued about 2 times more permanent bans than last year, a clear testament to the performance and evolution of our systems.\n\n## PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 BANS\n\nCheck out the last 12 months of perma-ban data, including new data for 2025.\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 R6 BanChart Apr24-Mar25 Y10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5t8iL2wnnwFAd9CAB4XprS/e25786b8b21aeb1ec4274cdf9b44fe3c/R6_BanChart_Apr24-Mar25_Y10S1.jpg)\n\n## FINAL NOTE\n\nWith *Siege X* on the horizon, R6 Shieldguard remains at the forefront of the fight against cheating. Our team is actively researching, developing, and evolving across all areas of the Anti-Cheat space. Whether you're playing on PC or Console, we have exciting plans to further enhance your experience and ensure a fair game for everyone.\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 Header AntiToxicity 150x960 Y10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/gzPAX6IJDVYgBv2fzTu4E/a54266af6d10c62c198b1025127661ab/Header_AntiToxicity_150x960_Y10S1.png)\n\nOperation Prep Phase marked the full release of the Reputation System; the Beta tag is gone, and Impacts are now online. This is the first time that players have seen rewards or repercussions based on their Reputation Standing alone, and today our Anti-Toxicity team will be detailing how Impacts have affected the game so far. The team will also be sharing a few details on upcoming updates, and how they plan to make Siege and its Anti-Toxicity systems better for everyone.\n\n## REPUTATION SYSTEM FULL RELEASE\n\n### STANDING DISTRIBUTION UPDATE - [IMPACTS LIVE]\n\nThe activation of Impacts has resulted in a positive change in player behavior, and we've got the data to show it. The percentage of players in positive Standings (Respectable, Esteemed, Exemplary) has increased across the board, while the percentage of those in negative Standings (Disruptive and Dishonorable) has reduced. We can see that players who were previously recurrently toxic have adapted to the new Impacts by changing their behavior. We'd also like to insist on the fact that \"Respectable\" is a good standing where players receive positive perks.\n\n__KEY STATS__\n\nIn comparison to last season we have seen:\n\n- A decrease of -23% players in Dishonorable.\n\n- An increase of +37% players in Exemplary.\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 R6 StandingsBarChart Y10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2smuGnYJ6wz52B5snczUID/014e5199bdda74868e3abb58b799fcba/R6_StandingsBarChart_Y10S1.jpg)\n\n### IMPACTS - NEGATIVE ACTIONS DECREASING\n\nThere are a number of in-game behaviors that have seen an improvement as part of the shift in Standing distribution. Here are a few stats showing just how behavior has changed in Y10S1 thanks to the full release of the Reputation System.\n\n- -21% change to the number of negative actions per player match (see graph below).\n\n- +21% change to the number of positive actions per player match (see graph below).\n\n- -22% intentional team kills in Ranked and -23% in Standard.\n\n- -16% abandoned matches in Ranked, and -14% in Standard.\n\n- -35% friendly gadget destruction in Ranked, and -43% in Standard.\n\nHere is a detailed look at the amount of negative actions completed per player match, where we can see an overall downward trend. Of course, we do expect these figures to evolve over time, and particularly within the first 90 days of Impact activation. Our team will continue to analyze this data as we move forward, reacting and adapting where necessary.\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 Y10S1 ReputationActions Season](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4j3O7IvIchWL791Nax2PIK/c14f3ea134d056927a640914345f6ba2/Y10S1_ReputationActions_Season.jpg)\n\n### DISHONORABLE - ADDITIONAL REPERCUSSIONS\n\nThis season, we added additional measures specifically targeting consistently toxic players. Dishonorable players who continue to significantly exceed the negative unit limit are now automatically temporarily banned. If those players continue to be disruptive after their return, they are manually reviewed for potential permanent ban.\n\n### TUNING, EXPANDING, QOL\n\nLooking ahead, we have plans to improve the Reputation System experience. Our plans include:\n\n- Introducing more nuanced team-kill tracking to alleviate frustration around unintentional incidents.\n\n- Enhancing and expanding positive action recognition.\n\n- Addressing new areas of concern that hinder a positive environment, such as in-game idling, boosting with cheaters, and more.\n\n## AUTOMATED TEXTCHAT MODERATION\n\n### FLAGS AND FALSE POSITIVES\n\nOur Automated Textchat Moderation is helping to reduce toxicity in the game. The percentage of removed and flagged messages has decreased by 50% since launch, even while more messages are being sent overall (see graph below). Over 200 million text chat messages are analyzed each month and fewer than 1% of these are being removed, with less than 2% being flagged.\n\nWe are continuously fine-tuning the system to minimize false positives as much as possible (any messages which are flagged or removed unnecessarily). Currently, false positives are estimated to make up 0.1% of all flagged or removed messages, equating to around 6,000 messages per month. We know that an incorrect flag feels unfair; rest assured that a single false positive should not severely impact your Reputation Standing. We rely on your help to improve the system by reporting any incorrect detections that you experience through [R6Fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/). Thanks for your cooperation!\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 R6 FlaggedMessages SeasonY10S1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7AIgzpTBbQ3FQXI63VtIbT/804c0d7a281b25d4a322fd6417d28093/R6_FlaggedMessages_SeasonY10S1.jpg)\n\n![[R6S] Player Protection Update Y10S1 R6 MessagesSent Y10S1 Final](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4tLppT7ZbZTIvTTRn1bpw3/0a077d28a56c1b9f13e762646b056c1c/R6_MessagesSent_Y10S1_Final.jpg)\n\n## WHAT ELSE IS COMING?\n\nWhile the Reputation System has our full and ongoing support, our team is also working on more features to improve the overall game experience, player comfort, and privacy.\n\n__Automated Voice Chat Moderation:__\n\n- Enhancing detection and enforcement to address the most toxic players using in-game voice chat, across both PC and consoles.\n\n__Improved Privacy Settings for PC and Consoles:__\n\n- Automatically assigning nicknames to players.\n\n- Enabling all privacy settings on consoles.\n\n__Enhanced Abandonment Penalty System:__\n\n- Reducing frustration caused by \"unfair\" abandonment penalties due to crashes.\n\n- Refining detection to focus on players who frequently abandon matches on a long window period.\n\n__Revamped In-Game Reporting:__\n\n- Introducing greater granularity to reporting options.\n\n- Providing players with clearer insights into how their reports are utilized.\n\n## FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe're pleased with the progress made in Siege this year when it comes to reducing toxicity and creating a more welcoming ecosystem. That said, we recognize there is still significant room for growth and refinement. Our ongoing challenge remains to be fostering a positive environment while staying true to the game's unique culture.

Bright ideas come from anywhere, which is why they fund projects anywhere in the world. And they fund research into any type of cancer, because there are over 200 types that all need different cures.\n\nSince 1979, Worldwide Cancer Research has invested over £200 million in more than 2,000 research projects in 35 countries worldwide, leading to some remarkable breakthroughs. But with cancer rates increasing, and global discovery research funding decreasing, it is imperative to push forward faster and fund more new projects every year.\n\nThis simply won't be possible without the continued support of incredible community of Curestarters - people who turn their compassion into action by supporting Worldwide Cancer Research's work - for themselves, for their loved ones, and for the millions of people around the world affected by cancer. Becoming a Curestarter is a positive way to be part of something bigger and to contribute to vital research that will save lives.\n\nMany of you have already become Curestarters by supporting the previous \"Sixth Guardian Health\" bundle. We invite you to support \"Sixth Guardian Hope\" and recruit others to become Curestarters to help fund visionary, game-changing research around the world, and take us one step closer to a day when no life is cut short by cancer.\n\nLearn more about Worldwide Cancer Research [here](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/).\n\n## WHAT RESEARCH WILL YOUR DONATIONS SUPPORT?\n\nAll net proceeds from your donations will go to Worldwide Cancer Research, with no less than $6 USD per bundle going to the charity.\n\n### SMART BOMBS: A NEW APPROACH\n\nOnce cancer has spread, or metastasized, it often becomes incurable. A pioneering new team of researchers led by Professor Roberta Tasso at the University of Genoa in Italy have an ambitious plan: to find new ways to deliver drugs directly to hard-to-treat breast cancer tumors. By using nanoparticles that occur naturally in our bodies as 'smart bombs', the team hope to be able to knock out tumors even after cancer has spread.\n\n![[R6S] Sixth Guardian HOPE Announce - smart bomb animation](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3psiRMkDS6JpHFi3pF5lmR/751fd23352294630d6d009595983427a/Smart_bomb_animation.mp4)\n\n### A MESSAGE FROM THE RESEARCHER\n\n\"I am truly delighted and honored that my project has been selected for the fundraising campaign in partnership with Ubisoft and the Rainbow Six Siege community.\n\nThis project, while challenging, offers great potential to advance cancer treatment, and it is thanks to your support that we are able to push boundaries in such a high-impact area of research. We are incredibly grateful for your belief in our work, which we hope will have a tangible impact on cancer therapy in the future.\"\n\n-Professor Roberta Tasso\n\nTogether, the Siege community has already raised nearly $100k USD for Worldwide Cancer Research by supporting the \"Sixth Guardian Health\" bundle for Twitch. Let's continue to push past that and help our partners support ground-breaking efforts in breast cancer research.\n\nIf you'd like to support Worldwide Cancer Research further, you can make direct donations [here](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/donate/).\n\n## A MESSAGE FROM WORLDWIDE CANCER RESEARCH\n\nYears of collaborative and pioneering research have led to incredible breakthroughs in how we prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. But it is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and too many people still have to say goodbye to a loved one too soon. In 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths worldwide from cancer, and currently, this number is predicted to almost double by 2050.\n\nBut cutting-edge science gives us hope for the future. By funding more discovery research into any type of cancer, anywhere in the world, Worldwide Cancer Research believes that we can be ready to face the cancer challenges of tomorrow.\n\n\"Our vision is to see a day when no life is cut short by cancer. For me, this sums up what most of us fear about cancer. The fear of losing time or a life that we really should have had. This includes the way cancer turns lives completely upside down.\"\n\n- Dr Helen Rippon, Worldwide Cancer Research Chief Executive\n\n## ABOUT THE SIXTH GUARDIAN PROGRAM\n\nSince the program's launch in 2020, together with our community, we have raised over $600,000 USD! We'd like to extend our thanks once again to our past Sixth Guardian Partners: [AbleGamers](https://ablegamers.org), [Stack Up](https://www.stackup.org), [Indspire](https://indspire.ca/), [ILGA World](https://ilga.org), [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com) and [Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/).\n\nTogether with our partners, we hope to unite the Rainbow Six Siege community and make positive changes outside of our game.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","shop","community"],"readTime":6,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/25izb8Ha0sFpDLgVuKf6gA/join-the-sixth-guardian-hope-fundraiser-for-worldwide-cancer-research","date":"2025-02-19T16:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"11OmVXw4ysjxBGg3lY6HtB","title":"Y10S1 Designer’s Notes","abstract":"In this latest edition of Designer’s Notes, we are sharing details on the balancing changes process and why we will not be pushing additional changes this season.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5gqBZqnHXGjO4w1J083rK5/c7758c6efef3020cc6ad2b6b485c441a/DESIGNER_NOTES_Y10S01_960x540.jpg","content":"In this latest edition of Designer's Notes, we are sharing details on the balancing changes process and why we will not be pushing additional changes this season.\n\n# YEAR 10 SEASON 1\n\nWe have decided to let the game stabilize for a bit longer than usual in preparation for everything coming and start the new Siege era with more stable data overall. Every patch we release, even though we are building towards a fixed direction, adds more entropy into the mix, making it harder to evaluate the impact of every change. However, we wanted to take this opportunity to share some insights about our thought processes.\n\n# BALANCING PROCESS INSIGHTS\n\nTo begin with, in the context of strategy and tactics, the defensive team typically holds the advantage. It's like assaulting a fortress; expecting the attacking force to have equal chances of victory as the defending force is unrealistic. Defenders have the privilege of choosing the battlefield; they are essentially playing at home. In a game like Siege, defenders also alter the battlefield every round, while attackers have a mere 180 seconds to analyze and execute a new strategy based on the information gathered, which might only be reliable for a brief period. This is why we aim for a 55% defensive win rate with a 5% tolerance.\n\nThe different matrices represent the big picture of the game and help us interpret its current state. We have plenty of them: different ranks, platforms, playlists, and even specific ones per map. Observing an outlier value triggers a discussion, not an immediate action. During these discussions, we focus on the overall vision of the game more than on the outlier. Siege has many moving parts, and even small changes can have significant consequences, which may not become apparent immediately and can take months or even years to fully manifest. This is why we continuously evaluate both new and old changes, as their effects on the game can vary from patch to patch. It's also important to highlight that buffs and nerfs are often two sides of the same coin. Buffing one operator typically means others are indirectly nerfed. As the buffed operator becomes more appealing, others with similar roles become less interesting, which has a similar effect to nerfing them. In reverse, nerfing an operator means that others are indirectly buffed and more appealing to use.\n\nWhen we see operators with very high presence, we see a reduction on variety. Playing and facing the same operators repeatedly can be boring and feel repetitive. Their ideal presence is around 13%, even though we don't aim strictly for this. If every operator were in their sweet spot data-wise, it would mean that everyone is viable in all situations, making operator selection feel meaningless. This is why we intend to make them situational, so the map, site, intel available, and team composition determine who is the best option. Every operator must be strong in the right situation but with flaws in the wrong one. On the other hand, operators with extremely low presence might be boring, not impactful enough, or simply not fitting into the current meta. And our approach is different depending on the reason.\n\nRegarding win deltas, they mostly represent how the operator is performing in the current meta rather than their inherent strength. We cannot say that Maverick is too weak when he can bypass any wall denial without help, or that Kapkan is too strong when there is always an Ash rushing without droning, leaving attackers one operator down 20 seconds into the round.\n\n# COMMUNITY FEEDBACK\n\nAdditionally to the hard data retrieved from your in-game matches, our teams also analyze your feedback via different means in order to have the best understanding of the current meta and what you, as players, have to say.\n\nThere are two approaches to gather player feedback, one could be considered as indirect and the other as direct. For the former, the feedback is found through the comments you naturally share on social media or other platforms and generally touches broader topics. The latter, on the other hand, requires targeted investigations. The intel is then collected through workshops involving experienced players and community members, topic-specific surveys, and Seasonal surveys. Once gathered, the feedback data is then translated into digestible formats for a better understanding of the community concerns, thoughts and ideas.\n\nWe will never say this enough: your feedback matters and changes the game. Please keep on sharing your thoughts on our different social media platforms and our dedicated Seasonal Surveys.\n\n# Y9S4 RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n![[R6S] Y10S1 Designer's Notes - rank dist pc](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1LzhpZqQCbj9nhrnOCP3by/8bf57df04734094cd433c84ac9c5d436/Y9S4_Rank_Distribution_PC.jpg)\n\n![[R6S] Y10S1 Designer's Notes - rank dist console](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5PVYgfHbrHy6Q2MDNbXkAf/21ee330a1e364c36a9dd30e57a9d6f9c/Y9S4_Rank_Distribution_Console.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":5,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/11OmVXw4ysjxBGg3lY6HtB/y10s1-designers-notes","date":"2025-02-18T14:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M","title":"Witness the start of Siege’s new era – Don’t miss the R6 Siege X showcase","abstract":"Celebrate the future of Rainbow Six Siege with us in Atlanta on March 13th!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/28DAhnCyWh17Tw23nJ6nnG/f0b0b58885f58679d92e89c2b097ce81/R6SX_SHOWCASE_UK.jpg","content":"A new era is on the horizon for Rainbow Six Siege ---one that sets the stage for the years to come of tactical and unique gameplay--- and we'd like to invite you to be a part of it: welcome to Siege X!\n\n## A NEW ERA IS ABOUT TO START\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KicgXPVOD4s\n\nThe R6 team has been working tirelessly to bring to life the biggest transformation in the game's history and its purpose is to reinforce Rainbow Six Siege's position at the top of tactical first-person shooters by introducing new ways to play, deepened tactical gameplay, refined game feel and major upgrades all around.

Today, our Anti-Cheat team will cover how we got here and what they've been working on, while sharing new data and analytics.\n\n## STATUS OVERVIEW\n\n### CHEAT VENDOR EXITS\n\nWe've touched on this before, but we'd like to share a little more on this here. Late last year, one of the most prevalent cheat vendors exited the Siege space. Leading up to this, the cheat vendor was either offline or being detected, meaning their cheats would be non-functional or result in a ban. This came from our multi-faceted approach to anti-cheat, combining measures in both detection and hardening. This has been a great success for Siege, and our mission is to continue making Siege less viable for cheat vendors.\n\n### CHEATER REPORTS DECREASING\n\n![-R6S- PLAYER PROTECTION - Y9S4 UPDATE - R6 CheaterReportChart 2024.VF.960x540](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/58eqpKWj8c09NyJRARqByq/ca64da1ab5d9427199a5be8c6f41c0c7/-R6S-_PLAYER_PROTECTION_-_Y9S4_UPDATE_-_R6_CheaterReportChart_2024.VF.960x540.jpg)\n\n__PC CHEATER REPORTS__\nCheater reports have been decreasing, and we've got all-new data to share on this. In the graph above, we can see that cheater reports have been consistently trending downward since the beginning of October, revealing that players are noticing the change in cheater presence. Cheater reports have now decreased by over 40% when compared to our highs of summer 2024, and year on year we've seen a drop upwards of 30%.\n\n__CONSOLE CHEATER REPORTS__\nConsole cheater reports have remained largely stable throughout the year. Reports did see an increase at the start of December, though we believe the majority of these are due to the [crossplay default setting bug](https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1864792815542194684) that players had experienced at the launch of Y9S4. We remain focused on our console Anti-Cheat efforts, with more details on MouseTrap below.\n\n### FUTURE UPDATES - OUR MISSION IS UNCHANGED\n\nThe fight is not over. We know that other cheat makers will attempt to take advantage of the space left behind by a cheat vendor that has pulled out. The removal of this cheat creator changes very little for the Anti-Cheat team roadmap: we will keep investing and innovating in new hardening and detection technologies, to the betterment of Siege.\n\n## MOUSETRAP - MOUSE & KEYBOARD DETECTION ON CONSOLE\n\n- Reminder: MouseTrap is our __console__ __Anti-Cheat__ which works to detect devices that enable the use of mouse and keyboard.\n\n### NEW PENALTY LIVE\n\nY9S4 saw the release of the new MouseTrap penalty system. If detected 3 times, spoofers are forced into the PC matchmaking pool with PC recoil enabled for 90 days. This is a stark change in severity compared to the previous system, which would reduce its effects as soon as the player stopped using a spoofing device. Such a change was made possible by updates to the AI model which reinforced accuracy and further diminished false positives.\n\nLooking at the season launch we know that console players may not have felt the full impact of MouseTrap (as shown in the graph above with a rise in cheater reports at the start of December), with a bug enabling Console to PC crossplay by default, resulting in controller players being unknowingly matched with PC players who were legitimately using keyboard and mouse.\n\nOverall, our data shows that the system is working as expected, detecting and applying penalties to spoofing device users, forcing them into the PC pool. We are confident in our detection, though we know that some players have been able to bypass detection this season. This bypass method is currently being investigated, and we'll be enabling a fix for this soon.\n\nWe are closely monitoring MouseTrap and will continue to do so as we ramp up its AI capabilities. Our team is looking into improvements and new ways to utilize AI, which will help us to bolster our detection of cheating on console.\n\n## RAGE CHEATING & GAMEPLAY VIOLATIONS\n\n- __Reminder__: Gameplay Violations are actions that are technically possible within the game engine but are in effect forbidden and not possible from a gameplay perspective, such as shooting while sprinting.\n\nY9S3 has been our best season yet against rage cheating, thanks to a new system we implemented which detects Gameplay Violations. This new system has rendered the use of rage cheats a guaranteed ban, and at its peak, even outperformed our Data Ban system. With this foundational tech in place, it is now easier for the team to implement new Gameplay Violations as rage cheats arise.\n\n## LAG EXPLOIT SOLUTIONS\n\nWe noticed a rise in new lag-based exploits at the beginning of Y9S4. These exploits, which can happen on console, abuse client-server synchronization using network lag. Our team has recently pushed a fix to address these exploits, with an accompanying ban wave. We'd also like to thank players and creators for their help here, as reports submitted via [R6Fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/) played a major role in our initial fixes. We'll continue to monitor this space closely.\n\n## ENCRYPTION - BINARY HARDENING\n\n- __Reminder__: Binary hardening is the act of using __encryption and hardening techniques__ to update the game code base and __enhance security__, and we've continued to deploy these updates to the game with each patch.\n\nIn Y9S4, we reinforced our hardening capacity even further, with more experts within the team working on improving game security. We've seen success from these efforts, with each patch this season resulting in a decrease in cheater reports and online mentions of cheats on patch day. As well as this, we can share that we're tracking another major cheat provider which has been offline since updates were deployed earlier this season. While we cannot delve into the details of each of our updates, we can confirm that they're delivering concrete results with increased offline time for cheat providers. We hope that you're feeling these results in-game too and as always, these efforts will continue.\n\n## SANCTIONS\n\n### CHEATER MATCH CANCELLATION\n\nWe had made the decision to hold Cheater Match Cancellation from the Y9S4 launch, so that additional time could be taken to ensure a smooth release. It's now live, having been activated in an update earlier this season. This has enabled cheaters to be kicked from a match as soon as a ban is issued, at which point the Cheater Match Cancellation feature will be triggered, cancelling the ongoing match for everyone. The result here is a reduction of player time being spent in unfair or illegitimate matches.\n\n### BOTTING SANCTIONS\n\n- __Reminder__: Botting refers to the use of automated programs designed to perform in-game actions without the interaction of a player.\n\nOur botting detection has been working well, though as we've heard from our community, the temporary bans which were being applied were not enough. With this in mind, we recently changed bans for botting to a permanent ban on the first offence. This change was made possible thanks to improvements in our detection system, leading to greater accuracy and system confidence.\n\n### BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 BANS\n\nOur ban data for 2024, updated to include October, November, and December.\n\nBelow are some key points we'd like to share:\n\n![-R6S- PLAYER PROTECTION - Y9S4 UPDATE - R6 BanChart Jan-Dec24.960x540](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1iU0rTnKZN1tYFQyDZyFJK/3d7eb01bf44386b1681582e86449655b/-R6S-_PLAYER_PROTECTION_-_Y9S4_UPDATE_-_R6_BanChart_Jan-Dec24.960x540.jpg)\n\n__AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, & OCTOBER - R6 BANS [Data Bans, Gameplay Violation Bans, & more]__\n\n- R6 Bans performed very well during these months. This was due to our implementation of Gameplay Violations detections, resulting in an uplift in bans for this period.\n\n__OCTOBER & NOVEMBER - BATTLEYE BANS__\n\n- BattlEye bans saw an increase in October and a secondary sharper increase in November. This was a direct result of our increased collaboration with BattlEye, and their own efforts to find new ways of detecting cheats.\n\n__DECEMBER__\n\n- December marked our latest season release, and while we see a decline in overall bans here, we also see that players have reported fewer cheaters compared to previous months (see Cheater Reports Trends above).\n\nAs of today, many cheats in the current landscape are either offline, having issues, or being detected by BattlEye.\n\n## FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAs you can see from what we've shared today, we've got a multi-pronged approach to Siege Anti-Cheat, and we've seen results over Y9S3 and Y9S4. We will keep pushing and bringing information to you as we move forward.\n\n![-R6S- PLAYER PROTECTION - Y9S4 UPDATE - Anti-Toxicity.ORANGE.150x960](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/29wv0cvRlakff16c42Ry9y/0ad4c5b42e5fd2aab4009049728ab12b/-R6S-_PLAYER_PROTECTION_-_Y9S4_UPDATE_-_Anti-Toxicity.ORANGE.150x960.png)\n\nY9S4 saw the release of some of our biggest initiatives in Anti-Toxicity with Automated Text Chat Moderation and the Reputation System Refresh. Let's dig into these with our Anti-Toxicity team and see how they've impacted the game and players so far.\n\n## REPUTATION SYSTEM REFRESH\n\n### INITIAL OVERVIEW\n\nThe Reputation System Refresh is here, and so far this season, its performance and impact has matched our core pillars  (transparency, understandability, and clarity) and expectations. We're finding that players who are regularly or highly toxic are correctly being classified as Dishonorable or Disruptive, while positive players and those who are adapting their behavior are having that reflected with the higher Standings of Respectable, Esteemed, and Exemplary.\n\n![-R6S- PLAYER PROTECTION - Y9S4 UPDATE - StandingsIcons.960x253](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/8iUfNvQUbty5ImfcGFAn4/c87dcaa61345a1702eeb2aa0e01870e5/-R6S-_PLAYER_PROTECTION_-_Y9S4_UPDATE_-_StandingsIcons.960x253.jpg)\n\n### STANDINGS BREAKDOWN\n\nHere we have a visual breakdown of the Standings distribution for Y9S4. Currently 1.21% of players are in the Dishonorable (lowest) bracket, with 2.58% being Disruptive (second lowest), and our points system is ensuring that it takes a number of consistent negative steps to get into these brackets. Avoiding negative behavior will help any player to attain the Respectable Standing, and being positive in our matches without negativity, will help you climb higher.\n\n![-R6S- PLAYER PROTECTION - Y9S4 UPDATE - StandingsBarChart.960X540](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1mEXrSiT43kN0q8Zm1FcCx/7e0a8930b69ea9e549965fd863134339/-R6S-_PLAYER_PROTECTION_-_Y9S4_UPDATE_-_StandingsBarChart.960X540.jpg)\n\nWe've seen feedback that it feels too difficult to attain the Exemplary standing and that only a small number of negative actions are needed before dropping out of it. This is by design, so behaviour in this Standing must be close to perfect.  \n\nOf course, we will continue to monitor player feedback ensuring that the system works as expected. We are confidently moving towards activating the Reputation System Impacts soon (impacts based on your Reputation Standing) and moving out of Beta.\n\n## AUTOMATED TEXT CHAT MODERATION\n\n### LAUNCH\n\nTo start with, we're happy with the introduction of automated text chat moderation in Siege. We know that we got some of the detections wrong, though we've built this system with responsive adaptability in mind, so we have been able to fix issues reported to us within the same day. Below are some examples of messages that were flagged in the early stages of release, that have since been resolved.\n\n- \"very well shot, masterful aim and play\"\n- \"ping4\"\n- \"put a mira\"\n- \"meastro down\"\n- \"toxic\"\n- \"emp\"\n- \"I shot at lion through the hatch\"\n\nWe know that in some cases players may come across examples of messages that should or shouldn't be flagged. We are constantly looking at player feedback to refine the system, and are using your reports to apply prompt fixes, improving the experience for everyone.\n\nWe've also resolved a bug where some normal messages could be removed if they were sent too quickly in a row, such as \"GG\" - this was fixed during the hotfix on December 18th.\n\n### IMPACT ON PLAYERS\n\nSince the launch of our automated moderation, we've seen the probability of seeing a player reported for abusive text chat drop by 33% overall, and alongside this, the amount of highly toxic players in text chat has been reduced by 80%.\n\nThese figures show that the Automated Text Chat Moderation has had an instant effect on how some players choose to communicate in-game, leading to a more positive experience overall. We will maintain our live balancing ensuring that we can continue protecting players from recurrent or high toxicity.\n\n## PRIVACY MODE - UNACCEPTABLE USERNAMES\n\nWe are aware that some toxicity remains in-game through the use of offensive Privacy Mode usernames. We are currently working to improve our Anti-Toxicity username solution, and we can confirm that using such usernames may result in a ban. We're constantly banning players who choose to go over the limit with their chosen Privacy Mode usernames.\n\n## UPCOMING\n\nWe want to keep you up to date with some of the other features and improvements that will be coming in the future. Here's a rundown on some topics we're working on in the background:\n\n- Automated Voice Chat Moderation\n- Improving privacy settings for PC and Consoles\n- Reworking in-game reports: Adding more granularity and improving the feedback loop\n- Improving the abandonment penalty system\n\n## OUR DIRECTION\n\nThe Reputation System Refresh has seen a successful release that has clearly affected the negative communication in-game. The Automated Text Chat Moderation is also working well, and while we're aware that balancing will always be needed, we're ensuring that we can remain reactive to bring change quickly. Our goal now is to work on bringing the Impacts portion of the Reputation System live, so that players can be recognised for their positivity, or helped towards rehabilitation with impacts on their usual in-game rewards.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","toxicity","anti-cheat"],"readTime":12,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/23HvPOVDBapE7jokNWIa1E/player-protection-y9s4-update","date":"2025-02-05T14:15:00.000Z"}]
