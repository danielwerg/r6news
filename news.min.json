In this blog, we'll shed some light on connectivity in 2023, look at what we've achieved, analyze any unplanned downtime, and take a peek at what the Connectivity team is working on.\n\n## A YEAR IN REVIEW\n\nFirstly, let's take a closer look at some of the changes brought to the game over the past year that had directly impacted Connectivity, so that we can deep dive into some of the solutions put in place to improve the overall player experience.\n\n### UNPLANNED MAJOR DOWNTIME  \n\nDowntime is likely to be the biggest concern for most players when it comes to connectivity. Downtime of a game's online services can have a wide array of causes, many of which are not linked to the game's servers themselves. Issues related to new features included as part of an update or the process and logistics behind patch deployment are just a couple of examples of triggers that could result in an online services outage. While our Connectivity team works to ensure our servers are ready for players at all times, we have multiple teams who are making improvements on their side too, with an aim to minimize these extra trigger sources as much as possible.\n\nBelow you will see the total unplanned major downtime for each month this year so far. We can see that while the most recent months of September and October have been a relative success, there are three main spikes throughout the year prior to this. Let’s inspect those spikes, why they occurred and how our teams responded.\n\n![[R6S] Classified: Connectivity 2023 - img V2](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/lOkeLV2qfvDeR0sHHUnRb/376e08c564de21f5fc8e73a5ffce7f8e/UnplannedDowntimeChart.v2.png)\n\n__JANUARY__\n\nJanuary saw 15 hours and 54 minutes of unplanned downtime with a number of unique causes being identified, part of which was related to the release of Crossplay. The Connectivity team worked through both December and January bringing stability to the game and establishing areas where revisions or improvements were required. Each instance of downtime was also independently investigated by our teams, with steps taken on how to avoid or mitigate the effects of similar issues in the future. Changes made as a result of the investigations have since helped to reduce impacts from similar events.\n\n__APRIL__\n\nIn April, we had 7 hours of unplanned outages across three separate incidents all again having a unique cause. In all cases, the Connectivity team was able to detect the point of failure which was causing players to be unable to connect, and was then able to make immediate or planned changes to our systems and procedures to remedy the issues going forward.\n\n__AUGUST__\n\nY8S3 Operation Heavy Mettle was released on August 29<sup>th</sup>, and with this we encountered a major outage with overall downtime totaling 17 hours and 49 minutes. In essence, this outage was caused by a specific group of conditions arising, which led to our services being unable to handle the high amount of players attempting to connect at season launch.\n\nTo alleviate the issue, the team [disabled systems](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1699467502332289494) that would deliver Rank information to players, while still allowing Rank calculations to take place in the background. This allowed players to connect, matchmake, and complete meaningful Ranked matches while the team continued their work to get the game services fully operational once more. The team was then able to reinstate the delivery of Rank information to the game once conditions were stable.\n\nIn response to this situation, teams were able to make both specific and systemic changes to help ensure that the same outcome would not be repeated under similar circumstances.\n\n### DDOS (Game server)\n\nWhen talking about game server DDOS, we're looking at DDOS that directly affects players as well as a group of matches hosted on the targeted game server. The team have previously implemented a feature to reduce the number of matches affected by these attacks, resulting in less players being ejected from matches. \n\nAlthough the team has made progress in this area this year, we know that players still experience some issues with this. We see your feedback; we want to share that our work continues in this area and that the team will be making further changes in the future to help improve this situation.\n\n### SERVER REGIONS & PING TESTING\n\nWhen a player boots up Siege, it checks to find the server which will provide the lowest ping based on the player's current location. This functionality has allowed us to run live tests using new data centers, while gathering performance data. These tests are helping us to understand how activating new locations can not only improve connectivity for certain communities, but also impact the experience of all the other players.\n\nDuring 2023, after such tests had been completed, the Connectivity team made two new server regions available (one for Korea and another one from Europe Central). We've found that these new locations have been a boost for many players, enabling them to play with decreased pings leading to an improved experience overall.\n\n__SERVER REGIONS - WHAT'S NEXT?__\n\nWe've got nothing final to announce regarding additional new server locations as of right now, though we can confirm that it's an area the Connectivity team is putting a lot of resources into. In the coming seasons, the team will be running new internal tests, and we'll share more updates on this as soon as results become available.\n\nIn addition to testing new server locations, the Connectivity team is also working on updating and evolving its tooling. This will allow the team to pull more detailed information regarding their usage and ultimately facilitate decision-making when it comes to deciding which regions could benefit from additional resources the most.\n\n### CROSSPLAY\n\nCrossplay was implemented back in December and has been one of the biggest online changes to come to Siege. The feature has been a great success, though it's important to highlight just how this affected our online services in the weeks following release. During this time, we did experience issues leading to downtime which ultimately stemmed from the Crossplay feature. These issues were due to the challenges of deploying such a game-changing feature, while ensuring that all of our systems were ready to provide a stable experience with this additional load. Crucially however, the team was able to ensure that the feature remained live, while bringing stability to the game's online services, providing a highly awaited change that many players had been asking for.\n\n### TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT\n\nOver the last few seasons, our teams have been working iteratively to replace older technology which is integral to our online services. Some of this technology has been in place since Siege's early development, and as the game continues to evolve, there is a need to ensure that we still have state-of-the-art systems in place. Once complete, our team and players alike will be looking to gain multiple advantages, including decreased maintenance downtime. \n\n### COLLABORATION\n\nAt Ubisoft we have a wide range of titles, each with their own Programming, Art, and of course, Connectivity teams. In the last year, our Connectivity team has found new ways to collaborate with such teams from other titles, including For Honor and Roller Champions. Since the new efforts were established, the data being shared has enabled us to mitigate online issues that might have otherwise affected players and has resulted in a significant positive impact overall.\n\n## LOOKING FORWARD\n\nThe team has made multiple learnings over past seasons and applied a number of changes while working on others which will be implemented in the future. While some of these changes only represent remedies for a fraction of causes, there is no doubt that the steps taken will be beneficial moving forward. \n\nTo sum-up, here's a look at some of the areas the Connectivity team is currently working on:\n\n- Putting strategies in place to minimize unplanned downtime.\n- Reducing the impact of game server DDOS.\n- Tightening collaboration with other titles including For Honor and Roller Champions.\n- Testing for possible new data centers.\n- Removal and replacement of old technologies used throughout the game's life.\n- And much more behind the scenes.\n\nThis is just a brief overview of what the Siege Connectivity team has been up to, we hope that this article provides useful insight into some of the topics that are being looked at. We want to add that this is only a snippet of what this team is working on, and we'll share more on this topic in the future.\n\nWe thank you for providing feedback on your online experience as it's extremely helpful to the team and we couldn't make improvements without you!","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":8,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3np0dmOyTZY3BVXe4qcRZQ/classified-connectivity","date":"2023-11-17T15:35:00.000Z"},{"id":"1BZt0t9asNHvdTBHU9OUGZ","title":"Y8S4 Designer's Notes","abstract":"In this latest edition of Designer’s Notes, we'll go into detail about the balancing changes that’ll come with the Y8S4 test server and give you some insight into the reasons behind them","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4OMngveP6mCNtRzteX20YT/133d5332d55a0eb5668e3e464cd76d6f/Y8S4_DesignersNotes_Header_960X540.jpg","content":"# BALANCING MATRIX AND TOP OPERATOR BANS\n\n## WIN DELTA VS.

Added fuse time reduction after the first bounce.\n- Initial fuse time: 4 seconds (from 5).\n- Reduced fuse time: 2 seconds.\n\nWe want to bring down the power level of the Frag Grenade to be in line with all the other Secondary Gadgets. Like all the others, it should be a weaker version of a Primary Gadget, such as the Hard Breach Charge for the Hard Breachers or the Bulletproof Camera for the Intel Gatherers. The secondary utility should not compete with or drive more attention than the main ability of an Operator. This change will put the spotlight back on Operators' abilities, and we will have more margin to make them excel in their roles.\n\nWe also want to increase the population of Frag Grenades, so more operators can get them without severely affecting their presence. We won't keep this utility as limited as it is right now forever because it conflicts with our intention to give as many options as possible to players to foster creativity.\n\nTo that end, we will remove the ability to cook grenades. This change removes a skill component when using them, but this aspect has been identified as the main reason why they are too powerful. Player ability can turn Frag Grenades into a better version of most operator abilities. Skilled players have reached a level that even ignores the correct counters for grenades, by killing defenders from below without warning.\n\nWe have not taken this decision lightly because of its impact on the skill ceiling when learning and mastering the use of Frag Grenades. We have adopted the fuse system from the Stun Grenade which means that the fuse time will be reduced to 2 seconds after the first Bounce (if the time is higher), so you'll still retain some control over the gadget. Reducing that skill ceiling is our last resort when tweaking a gadget, as we generally aim for the opposite.\n\nWe have tested multiple ideas looking for the right solution for the Frag Grenade's power level while keeping its identity intact. Here are a few of the changes we explored but ultimately did not implement:\n\n- __Damage through surfaces__: Here, we wanted to fix the competitive issue with a direct approach. We tested several options, from only reducing the damage below the lethal threshold to completely removing it along with the destruction. This solved the usage from the floor below against operators, but it didn't affect their power level for the majority of the population, so we wouldn't be able to give them to more operators.\n- __Non-lethal__: The most appealing aspect is the lethality, so we tried to reduce it directly. We tested reducing the base damage to non-lethal, so you'd have to land several Frag Grenades to kill your target. Not being able to guarantee the kill with a single throw achieved most of our objectives, but it also destroyed part of gadget's personality.\n- __Reduce amount__: We evaluated reducing the amount to only 1 per operator to see if it was enough to make the other options more appealing. Unfortunately, this change made them too binary; we only removed the ability to try again if you missed the target. If you were accurate, you could still achieve the same results, and this potential was deemed enough to favor selecting a single Frag Grenade over any other gadget.\n- __Random fuse time__: With this prototype, we tried to add a bit of uncertainty to discourage players from cooking the grenades too accurately. They are super dangerous, so it is not a device you should want around when the detonation mechanism is triggered. We changed the fuse time to be between 3 and 5 seconds. This version achieved several of our goals because the players weren't as accurate with them as they were with the live version and gave defenders time to react, which made them more interactive. But despite being a fun prototype, adding more randomness into the game while we are trying to remove it from other areas didn't convince us.\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n### IQ\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades.\n\n#### 552 COMMANDO\n\n- Damage: 43hp (from 47).\n- Stronger vertical and horizontal recoil.\n\nFinally, IQ gets Frag Grenades back. We will see if she can keep them depending on the power level of the new version and how her having them affects other interactions in the game. She is an intel gatherer, and her intel can help attackers use resources and time more efficiently. We don't want her increased utility to overshadow the team play.\n\nWe love her relationship with the EMP Impact Grenade. Having her on the team avoids putting drones in danger or wasting EMPs trying to hit an electricity source. She can also help the team use anti-utility gadgets more efficiently by seeing which ones are protected. She can find electronic gadgets that are normally hard to locate and track enemies using them.\n\nBecause of the increased utility and versatility, we must reduce the 552 Commando's fire power. We will reduce its damage to make the Extended Barrel combo weaker. With the new damage, 1-armor operators will take 3 bullets instead of 2 to get downed. We've also made its recoil more challenging to control, which will bring it in line with other Assault Rifles.\n\nIQ is a team player. She helps the team be more efficient and is one of the best representations of the essence of Siege.\n\n### LION\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades, Removed EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nLion and Frag Grenades were previously incompatible as the EE-ONE-D forces defenders to stay still giving the defender no options against a cooked grenade.\n\nWe are reconsidering his candidacy now because of the new synergy with the detonation system. The new Frag Grenade will force targets to move instead of killing them right away, pushing defenders into the EE-ONE-D's detection. The defender will have to think fast to evaluate the different options and decide the best course of action.\n\nWe are swapping them for the EMP Impact Grenades because they are the least picked option, and of course, removing the Gonne-6.\n\n### SENS\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades.\n\nYou must master the R.O.U. Projector and the new Frag Grenade to make use of Sens' full potential. They have the ability to block multiple lines of sight, pressure enemies out of strong positions, and even force them to cross the light screens. This will increase Sens' skill ceiling even more.\n\nSens has a projectile as their main ability, and it goes against a rule we broke with Gridlock in Y8S3.3 (allowing both a throwable unique ability and Frag Grenades). We will test if this rule should remain in place with the updated Frag Grenade, or if it allows more flexibility with the distribution.\n\n### OSA\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades. Removed Smoke Grenades.\n\nThe new Frag Grenades will replace Osa's Smoke Grenades, as it was her least picked secondary gadget option (only 15% of the rounds).\n\nOsa allows attackers to create a setup, something that was exclusive for defenders until she arrived. She approaches the assault in a more methodical way, gaining terrain from defenders, but she cannot do it without help. This makes her a good candidate for this extra utility, as it is gameplay we want to encourage, but she still has good synergy with all the other secondary options, so we hope all of them will remain interesting.\n\n### BLACKBEARD\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades. Removed EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nBlackbeard is the last attacker receiving Frag Grenades. His low presence made him an easy selection and since the Claymore is still a good option, we hope choosing between the two isn't easy or at least depends on the way you intend to play the round.\n\n### CAPITÃO\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nWe have decided to give Capitão EMP Impact Grenades to compensate for their removal from other operators and make choosing between him and Osa a bit tougher. Having Hard Breach Charges and EMPs to choose from can allow him to fit into more attacking compositions.\n\n### GRIM\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added EMP Impact Grenades. Removed Breach Charges.\n\n##### 552 COMMANDO\n\n- Damage: 43hp (from 47)\n- Stronger vertical and horizontal recoil.\n\nWe are pretty happy with the results of all of Grim's buffs. Unfortunately, he shares the 552 Commando with IQ, so the changes made to it will also affect him. To compensate for that, and recoup some of the EMP Impact Grenades removed, he will also get them, replacing the Breach Charges. We believe it is a fair exchange; losing some frag potential but gaining flexibility now with the Bailiff 410 for soft destruction.\n\n### MIRA\n\n##### BULLETPROOF GLASS\n\n- The bulletproof glass will be shattered if a Drilling Projectile explodes successfully after drilling into it.\n- This change affects all bulletproof glass: Black Mirror Window, Evil Eye, Talon Shield, Bulletproof Camera, Deployable Shield.\n\n##### ASH'S BREACHING ROUND\n\n- The Breaching Round is considered a Drilling Projectile.\n\n##### KALI'S V-LANCE\n\n- The V-Lance is considered a Drilling Projectile.\n- Note that the V-Lance doesn't drill through gadgets; it only drills through surfaces (the Black Mirror Window is considered part of the wall).\n\nMira is a game-changing operator. If you spot her during the Preparation Phase, you know that something will have to change in the way you execute the attack. We love the effect she has in game, but we believe the reason for her high ban rate is purely strategic. You don't want to deal with her in situations where she alone defines the pace of the round.\n\nWe introduced the Shattered Glass system back in Y6S3 to give attackers more ways to deal with the Black Mirror Windows and penalize bad usage. We are very happy with the results, so we are going to expand that system by adding new sources, so attackers have more flexibility when spotting a Mira.\n\nWe have defined a new projectile category; \"Drilling projectiles\". These projectiles drill into the surface they impact to apply their effect. They'll explode from the inside of the surface to deal more damage and will now shatter bulletproof glass. For instance, if Ash's Breaching Round sticks to the Black Mirror glass and explodes successfully, the glass will be shattered.\n\n### MAESTRO\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Main Ability: 3 Evil Eyes (from 2)\n\n##### EVIL EYE\n\n- Battery: 6 seconds (from 5)\n- Overheat: 6 seconds (from 5)\n\nMaestro has been indirectly nerfed repeatedly since the release and introduction of new systems (Shattered Glass, Outside Cameras), new operators (Flores, Brava), new gadgets (Gonne-6, EMP Impact Grenades), and tweaks to operators (Dokkaebi) and now again with the increased population of Frag Grenades. Because of all this and the current meta, his presence has understandably gone down to be one of the least-picked defenders. \n\nThe changes to Evil Eyes should make attackers treat them with more respect. The new battery will allow Maestro to kill 1-armor operators with a single turret and down 2 to 3-armor operators. Increasing the number of Evil Eyes to 3 will increase his flexibility, requiring at least two operators with the proper secondary utility to deal with all of Maestro's utility, helping him become the master of intel that he should be.\n\n## PLAYLIST ECOSYSTEM CHANGES\n\n### QUICK MATCH AND STANDARD\n\nWe feel confident about the Quick Match changes introduced last season. The faster match time provides players a much faster paced experience. Attacker Vanguard allows players a safer approach to the action and Pre-Setups let defenders play fast without having to forfeit the strategic element of reinforcements.\n\nHaving said that, we are aware of the community's concerns regarding the new playlist ecosystem, and we realize that we made changes to the Standard mode before having the completed map pool available in Quick Match. Therefore, we are making the Standard map pool the same as Ranked while we dedicate our efforts to adding all the maps back to Quick Match as soon as possible. Once the map pool is completed, we will allocate some time to revisit Standard's map pool and provide more options for players to enjoy the maps that they want. We are working on a proposal to bring back player agency by allowing you to enjoy Standard's map pool with some control over it.\n\n##### QUICK MATCH MAP POOL UPDATE\n\n##### Added:\n\n- Hereford Base\n- Plane\n- Presidential Plane\n- Yacht\n- Fortress\n- Emerald Plains\n- Stadium\n- NightHaven\n- Lair\n\n##### STANDARD MAP POOL UPDATE\n\n- Oregon\n- Club House\n- Consulate\n- Bank\n- Kanal\n- Chalet\n- Kafe Dostoyevsky\n- Border\n- Skyscraper\n- Coastline\n- Themepark\n- Villa\n- Outback\n- Emerald Plains\n- NightHaven\n- Lair\n\n<hr>\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":12,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1BZt0t9asNHvdTBHU9OUGZ/y8s4-designers-notes","date":"2023-11-13T14:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"5BjYOwmKyyk6zwN6rwDxas","title":"“Acceptable casualties?

The new season is just around the corner, and there's no better time to introduce our newest Defense Operator Isaac \"Tubarão\" Nunes Oliviera. \n\nGrowing up in Ponta Delgada in Portugal, earthquakes and underwater eruptions were the norm. It taught Tubarão the value of mutual aid and community, making him a perfect fit for WOLFGUARD. He takes accountability for every life in his jurisdiction, and his teammates will be thankful for the freezing power of the ZOTO CANISTER. Not only can it slow opponents, the ZOTO CANISTER freezes electronic devices, and can even pause deployment for mechanical devices.  \n\nThe ZOTO CANISTER is a throwable device that can stick to any surface with a lot of utility. It can insulate metal from electricity, and even reveal footprints if the opponent walks on the frozen area. Attack Operators will want to wait for the freezing effect to dissipate before pushing in, but if you can't wait, Buck's SKELETON KEY or Sledge's TACTICAL BREACHING HAMMER can be reliable options against the ZOTO CANISTER. \n\nWith the NITRO CELL and PROXIMITY ALARM as secondary options, Tubarão focuses on utility denial making him a great operator for asymmetric strategies with focus on verticality. 2 HEALTH, 2 SPEED, and the AR-15 and MPX as primary weapon options and the P226 MK25 as his secondary weapon, denying breach from the attack is the foundation of Tubarão's gameplay. \n\nTubarão is driven by his unwavering dedication to civilian safety. During his time in the DAE, he would always ensure that civilians were insulated from hostile activity, going above and beyond what anyone else would do. His empathy and skills made him a high performing specialist, the perfect candidate to be recruited in to WOLFGUARD. \n\nTest out Tubarão and his chilling abilities on the Test Server starting November 13.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5BjYOwmKyyk6zwN6rwDxas/acceptable-casualties-nah-tubaro","date":"2023-11-13T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"5elVeFwuDGjHBeNxPEoZNT","title":"Y8S3 MID-SEASON ROADMAP UPDATE","abstract":"Check out what's coming to Rainbow Six Siege in the Y8S3 Mid-Season Roadmap Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/cZJILTiwMxq1OTiDdGecH/fe73759c7f01910e802faf5426022bfc/Y8S3_Mid-Season_Update.960x540.png","content":"Every season when we roll out fresh content, we also provide an updated Roadmap to ensure transparency on upcoming features. When making those adjustments, we take various elements into account, including your feedback. Furthermore, we aim to offer additional insight into what you can anticipate from the upcoming Operation.\n\nNow let's delve into the mid-season Roadmap update.\n\n![[R6S] Y8S3 Mid-Season Roadmap Update - roadmap](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1ka2ZvpGF2YliVxQ48GKS0/74dbc351eeddeca1d472d1a9a788d9d3/R6SIEGE_Y8_Roadmap_1920x1080_UK.jpg)\n\n## ROADMAP UPDATES\n\n### [MAIN FEATURE] NEW MAP\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nY8S4 will bring an exciting addition to the Rainbow Six Siege map lineup. We have been building a new map on the foundation of verticality with carefully designed layouts and fresh avenues for strategic possibilities like never before! Make sure to watch the Y8S4 reveal panel to discover more!\n\n### [MAIN FEATURE] NEW VERSUS AI PLAYLIST\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nThis season will keep on delivering with the incorporation of a new versus AI Playlist tailored to let new players sharpen their skills against specially AI trained Defender bots to become the best operator they can be. Practice, strategize, and dominate like never before in this dynamic training environment. \n\n### [BALANCING] [BETA] REVAMPED SHIELD MECHANISM\n\n- __Status: BETA confirmed during Y8S4__\n\nShields have been part of Siege since the beginning and have sometimes seemed unbalanced with the current playstyles. As a game striving for tactical depth, we're committed to integrating shields seamlessly into gameplay without compromising immersion. We have been working on this strategy from the ground up, redesigning ballistic shields while retaining a unique playstyle which is both balanced and immersive. Brace yourselves for the first iteration of this revamped mechanism, available later during Y8S4 on the Lab TS. \n\n### [PLAYER COMFORT] CONTROLLER REMAPPING\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nWe are actively working on improving our players' comfort on consoles. In Y8S4, we will be providing an easy way to completely customize your controller inputs. This long-requested feature is dedicated to ensuring it answers all our console players' needs. Taking your feedback into account, we will also implement a new action to allow leaning while hip-firing on Consoles later in the season!\n\n### [BALANCING] [NEW] UPDATED FRAG GRENADES\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nAs announced in the last [Siege Classified: Balancing](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1694016584371634344?s=20), Frag Grenades have risen to an overpowered position in the current meta. They currently heavily influence Operator choices, tilting the balance between primary and secondary gadgets in an unbalanced way. With our commitment to providing the best FPS competitive experience, we have thoroughly examined Frag Grenades and rebalanced their impact to be more in line with all the other Secondary Gadgets. More information on this balancing change will be shared during the reveal panel, so everyone can have a blast playing Siege, so stay tuned!\n\n### [PLAYER PROTECTION] NEW RANKED REQUIREMENTS\n\n- __Status: Coming in Y9__\n\nRanked is the most popular competitive mode in Siege. Hence, it's no surprise that it's always in our line of sight in terms of priority, ensuring that players can enjoy a balanced competitive experience, both with and against similarly skilled players. We are committed to making sure Ranked is a fair environment and are adding more Ranked requirements to reinforce the core experience.\n\n### [PLAYER PROTECTION] PRIVACY MODE ON CONSOLES\n\n- __Status: Cancelled__\n\nThe work required to deliver Privacy Mode on consoles has brought up external challenges that came up late in the process. As well as this, new privacy features have been made available inside of the console ecosystem itself. For this reason, we've made the tough decision to stop the development of this feature on consoles specifically for the time being. \n\nAs you know, Player Protection remains a top priority, and we are committed to improving your experience and making Siege an even safer and fairer game to play on consoles.

This will cripple the run & gun capabilities of reckless players that separate from their teams and fall into Welcome Mats.\n-   __Slower Revive Animation__: Trapped players will now need 4 seconds to exit the trap regardless of the revive method. This should grant extra time for defenders to finish off trapped enemies before they can stand up.\n\n#### WELCOME MAT\n\n-   Welcome Mat Removal by Teammate takes 4 seconds (was 4.3 seconds). No debuff applied.\n-   Welcome Mat Removal by Self takes 4 seconds (was 2.5 seconds).\n-   If players remove the trap by themselves, a debuff will be applied to them. The effects are as follow:\n\n-   Duration is 60 seconds (Was 20 seconds on the Lab Test Server).\n-   Will move 20% slower\n-   Won't be able to sprint.\n-   Will leave a trail of blood behind them.\n-   Health is set to 20 hp. \n\n-   Being caught by a Welcome Mat is considered entering the Down But Not Out state. R6 allows DBNO only once per round, this means players that have already been DBNO will immediately die if they fall into a Frost trap.\n\nWe have two main objectives with this set of changes, the first is to make the placement of Welcome Mats more strategic and less \"deploy and forget.\" The second is to make being caught by Welcome Mats less frustrating by giving more options to players.\n\nPlayers will have now two options to escape from a Welcome Mat, they can wait for a Teammate to help them, or they can release from the trap by themselves at the cost of receiving a penalty with several negative effects that will impact their movement speed.\n\n#### FRAG GRENADES\n\nAs mentioned in the Y8S3 Designer's Notes, the next few changes are in preparation for a more definitive solution that intends to address the Frag Grenades issue.\n\n### IANA\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Gadgets: Stun Grenades will replace Frag Grenades.\n-   Secondary Weapon: Added Gonne-6.\n\nIana has been the top Attacker for almost a year since we removed Frag Grenades from Finka and changed Sledge's and Zofia's armor rates. It is time for a change that leaves more space for other Operators to excel. We are replacing the Frag Grenades with Stun Grenades to retain Iana's aggressive playstyle and adding the Gonne-6 to keep a bit of her destructive power.\n\n### FINKA\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades as 3rd option.\n-   Secondary Weapon: Removed Gonne-6.\n\nWe needed to add another 'competitive' operator to replace Iana during this transition period. We already know that Finka is a good fit and could take this spot. Now that the LMG-meta has been adjusted, we believe that she can have Frag Grenades again.\n\nShe won't keep the Gonne-6 however, as the combination of it and Frag Grenades will be limited to special cases.\n\n### GRIDLOCK\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Gadgets: Frag Grenades will replace Breach Charges.\n-   Secondary Weapon: Removed Gonne-6.\n\nTo allow for more operator diversity on the attacking line-up, we are also going to give Gridlock Frag Grenades instead of Breach Charges, she already has the Super Shorty for soft destruction, so we'll remove the Gonne-6.\n\n### SENS\n\n#### POF-9 (PC & Console)\n\n- Reduced vertical recoil.\n- Reduced lateral recoil.\n- Reduced recoil increase after long bursts\n\nWe believe that Sens is an operator with great potential, but it looks like they'll need a push to shine. We made them a 1-Armor and 3-Speed operator back in Y7S4, and softened the POF-9 recoil for Gamepad in Y7S3, but that wasn't enough. Operator weapons have a lot of weight on their performance, so we are taking a second look at the POF-9, but this time for both Mouse and Gamepad.\n\nThis weapon has been considered challenging to operate for a long time, and we've decided to soften its recoil. With this change we are aiming to have a weapon that feels way more forgiving to use. This should allow players to perform better with the POF-9 at longer distances and grant them more freedom to pick its weapon attachments.\n\n### TACHANKA\n\n#### DP27\n\n-   Damage: Increase to 60 (from 49)\n\nDespite the high damage, the time to kill is much higher than average regardless of enemy armor because of the low rate of fire. We never increased it because we didn't want to go lower than 3 bullets to down a player with any automatic weapon, but the recent changes on the Extended Barrel have proven that this is fine for certain operators.\n\nSo, with this change, the DP27 will be closer to other weapons with higher rates of fire in terms of time to kill a full health operator, especially against high-speed operators.\n\n-   1-armor: 0.218ms (faster than average)\n-   2-armor: 0.218ms (faster than average)\n-   3.-armor: 0.327ms (slower than average)\n\n### WARDEN\n\n#### OPERATOR STATS\n\n-   Armor: 3 (from 2)\n-   Speed: 1 (from 2)\n\nWe changed Warden to 2-Armor and 2-Speed by the end of Y4 to increase his mobility and allow him to react faster to the Attacking team. With the evolution of the game, and defenders playing more loosely than back then we will drop his speed to reduce his roaming capabilities.\n\nWe believe the 1.5x on the MPX, synergizes well with his kit to counter Smokes from far away, so rather than change that we are going to reduce his speed. He will be slower and louder while running around the map, which will make him an easier target to take down by more coordinated teams.\n\nWe want to encourage players to play him closer to the site, where he can use his ability more effectively because flashes and smokes are easier to predict. He should be a critical operator to keep alive until the end of the round because can counter most of the attacking strategies. He shouldn't be the one to go for roaming and dying too early.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":8,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2iIXX6OEAI1g1b9Q3ta6lU/y8s33-designers-notes","date":"2023-10-06T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"5Jd2jnLL5jOGzD7xMpJNKX","title":"Rainbow Six Siege X Halo Crossover Brings Master Chief Set for Sledge","abstract":"New Elite set now available for Sledge, includes Spartan-117 headgear, uniform, gadget skin, weapon skins, and more, plus a Cortana Chibi charm.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/569NLMCWWrD9WyzMBZtu74/8cd0f8219a2a76fd5e425d5ce3a962b1/Sledge_Elite_Halo_960x540.jpg","content":"It's time to siege the day and finish the fight as Rainbow Six Siege introduces a new Halo crossover featuring an Elite set for Sledge that outfits him in the armor of the Master Chief.

The Commendation System gives teammates a new avenue to share their thanks and appreciation with one another, while showing how they've added to the experience. In Siege your team matters, and any team member can be key to your victory and enjoyment. With this update, you can show players your gratitude and allow them to shine.\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\n### COMMENDING OTHERS\n\nPlayers will be able to give Commendations at the end of a Quick Match, Standard, or Ranked game, via the Commendation screen. Each session, players can commend up to two teammates by selecting one of three categories.\n\nAs well as showing your appreciation to teammates, you can vote to commend the opposing team. In order for the vote to be successful, a majority \"YES\" vote will be required.\n\n__RESTRICTIONS:__\n\n- Players who abandon the match won't be eligible for Commendations.\n\n- A player cannot give both of their Commendations to the same person.\n\n- To prevent abuse of the system, a player cannot award more than one Commendation to the same player within a 7 day period.\n\n### COMMENDATION TYPES\n\nWhen it comes to giving out your Commendations to your teammates, you'll have 3 options, and choosing the right one will help players know how their efforts have added to your experience.\n\n- __Valor__: A great teammate who stays cool and is fun to play with.\n\n- __Dedication__: A reliable teammate who stays engaged, fills in roles, and actively relays intel.\n\n- __Guidance__: A teammate who takes on a leadership role, helping the others by sharing knowledge and developing strategy.\n\n## WHAT COMMENDATIONS MEAN FOR YOU\n\nReceiving Commendations can result in rewards being given at certain points in a season, as well as a temporary passive bonus. Note that right now, it will not affect your Reputation Standing.\n\n### STREAKS\n\nIf a player receives Commendations consistently, a Streak bonus will be activated, giving a +1% drop chance on their Alpha Packs. The Streak status will be reflected in the in the Reputation Center, in the main menu squad panel, and in matches for other players to see. Of course, if a player wishes to protect their privacy, this icon can be disabled as part of Privacy Mode.\n\n__RESTRICTIONS__\n\n- Players who have a sanction or reputation penalty will have their Streak stopped and will be unable to attain a new Streak.\n\n### REWARDS\n\nAs well as an increased Alpha Pack drop rate, if you meet the right requirements, you could qualify for more rewards.\n\n- At __mid-season__, any player who has received a Commendation in the current season, will receive an Alpha Pack of Epic rarity.\n\n- At the __end of a season__, players in the top 25% of Commendations for that season, will receive an Alpha Pack of Legendary rarity.\n\n__RESTRICTIONS__\n\nThe following players will not be eligible for mid-season or end of season rewards:\n\n- Players who are under sanction of any sort.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Player Protection team continues their work on both the Commendation System and Reputation System, helping to support and protect players' journeys in Siege. With this update, our aim has been to increase the opportunities for positive interactions in-game, with the ultimate goal of giving players a more positive overall experience. We look forward to players using the system, earning Streaks, and receiving their Alpha Packs!","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":3,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2YtRrSCEi2eWoYEksA44FV/commendation-system-how-it-works","date":"2023-09-14T13:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"7nCrDQJ0J7KWfQcpUYvw0k","title":"Y8S3.1 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S3.1.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5ZPI2tDO4kU3Q3nuEBTyxr/359940c5f44b824b8257415bc2010684/Y8S3.1_PatchNotes_Article.jpg","content":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S3.1.\n\n## Y8S3.1 Patch Size\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 5.82 GB\n\n- Steam: 16.9 GB\n\n- Xbox One: 3.09 GB\n\n- Xbox Series X: 3.27 GB\n\n- PS4: 3.99 GB\n\n- PS5: 3.26 GB\n\n## BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED -

All of my friends were playing it, so that attracted me to the game, and as I played it more and more, I fell in love with it.\n\n__When you sit down to play a session, what are you hoping to get out of it? What kind of competitive spirit do you bring to Siege?__\n\n__DM:__ I want to have fun and be competitive. It's in my nature that I want to win at everything, and this game allows both - to have fun combined with the will to win.   \n\n__With all your travel and competition commitments, where and when do you usually find time to play Siege?__\n\n__DM:__  To be honest, I do not play when I travel for tournaments; I would be in trouble, as I would not go to sleep on time, so I only play when I am at home. I wish I could play more, but I also have to practice some tennis.\n\n__Rainbow Six Siege is a game that rewards strategizing in advance and adapting your tactics in the moment. How do you think your tennis career has influenced how you play Siege?__\n\n__DM:__  Timing is very important; like in tennis, you need to find a good moment to attack. And, just as in tennis, you need to make a plan. But if the plan is not working, finding the right time to switch to a new plan is key. I guess my experience as a pro tennis player helps me with this.\n\n__Have you ever tried to recruit any of your coaches or fellow players to join a 5-stack?__\n\n__DM:__  No, they would not be good enough, so I have not asked them to join. I started playing this game with my friends, and we have made some great memories. Spending all this time playing together, you really build a bond.\n\n__What's one piece of advice you'd give players looking to get into Siege or to elevate their game?__\n\n__DM:__  Two things: First, play to win, be competitive. And second, practice your aim.\n\n<b>Fill in the blanks: If you are matched against Daniil Medvedev in Ranked play, you should always ban the  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> map because  <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.</b>\n\n__DM:__  You should ban Kanal because it's my best map.

Our balancing philosophy is all about providing you with the right set of tools to confront very specific situations: for any situation you encounter in the game, there should be wide (but also limited) solutions.\n\nThis year, we aim to __reduce the strong jack-of-all-trades operators__ to ensure every decision you make has a thoughtful process behind it. We also want to continue to __enhance the game's tactical playstyle by__ __working towards balancing solutions which emphasize the importance of our operator's gadgets__.\n\nYou will find more details on our vision and plans below, as well as a rundown of our priorities for the rest of Year 8.\n\n## YEAR 8 AND BEYOND\n\n### ATTACHMENTS, ADS & FRAGS\n\nWe are aware of current community concerns surrounding the 1.5x sight. While your attachment choices should be meaningful, it shouldn't drive your operator pick. To this end, the Balancing team has been working over the past few months on new vectors to balance our operators and their loadouts.\n\nRight now, both Frag Grenades and the 1.5x sight are highly utilized and can have a large effect on the success and presence of an operator. Swapping these between loadouts is a short-term solution, and we are currently taking the time needed to polish a larger set of changes that will bring more sustainable balancing levers, allowing us to make less \"binary\" changes in the future. The team is actively working on a solution for this complex and entrenched issue in the game's meta.\n\n### OPERATOR BALANCING & TACTICAL GAMEPLAY\n\nWe recognize that a number of operators such as Iana, Azami, Warden, Solis and Blackbeard, don't feel right at the moment, and of course Recruit shares a similar position. We are in the process of prototyping effective solutions to make these feel balanced and worthy.\n\nIn an upcoming mid-season update, we'll be making a number of short-term adjustments to help boost operator presence and variety, or to reign it in where needed.  In parallel to this, we have longer-term plans in the pipeline for our weaker and more powerful operators. These plans will help to reinforce the tactical gameplay that Siege is known for, bringing the focus back to gadgets and utilities. With this, running and gunning will come with increased risk and difficulty.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of work to be done until we can bring all those solutions to the live server due to the nature of some of these changes. In the meantime, we continue to bring you balancing updates by selecting topics which, on one hand, allow us to make the necessary adjustments to the meta and work towards this goal, and on the other hand, aren't taking too much time or resources away from these longer-term plans and priorities.\n\n## COMING UP IN YEAR 8 AND MORE\n\n### Y8S3 - GRIM BUFF (PART 2) - KAWAN HIVE LAUNCHER\n\nWith part one of Grim's buff released in Y8S2, it's now time to look at what's next. In Y8S3, we will enable Grim to switch the firing mode on the Kawan Hive Launcher, with the alternative mode making Kawan Hives bounce off of surfaces rather than sticking to them. The update will increase Grim's versatility, giving players the ability to bounce Kawan Hives around corners and removing the line of sight requirement. This change completes our current vision for Grim and we're looking forward to seeing how players make use of this evolution.\n\n### Y8S3.3 - FROST'S WELCOME MAT REWORK\n\nAfter internal play sessions and a release on the Test Server, we felt like there was still work to be done on the Frost rework, and so we have made meaningful adjustments for the final release.\n\n__WHAT HAS CHANGED?__\n\n- Increased self-revive time\n\n- Extended and made the debuff more severe after self-reviving\n\n- Allowing teammate revive, cancelling the debuff activation\n\nThese changes make self-reviving from a Welcome Mat a much more dangerous and rewarding feat. It will allow Frost players more time to react, and this coupled with the increased debuff, will make sure that players don't want to fall victim to the traps. At the same time, with a teammate revive being an enticing option, Frost players are still going to find those \"double kill\" opportunities.\n\nWe'll be releasing this rework during Y8S3 and carefully evaluating Frost's performance throughout the season.\n\n__WHY DOES THE WELCOME MAT NEED A CHANGE?__\n\nCurrently, if an attacker falls victim to a Welcome Mat, a player is left trapped, out of options, and effectively removed from the action. We don't want players to feel helpless in any situation; an operator should always have options, even if they are limited. With this being the case, we feel that a change to the way that Welcome Mats work is needed, in order to improve the experience for stricken players. With this change we're enabling players to take action, giving them the ability to remove themselves from the Welcome Mat, however, during and after their attempted escape, players are going to feel vulnerable. Critically though, with the usual sound cues and the addition of blood trails, the huntress can still be ready to take care of her foes.\n\n### Y8S3 - FUZE'S CLUSTER CHARGE\n\nFuze packs high fire power but can still feel limited in many circumstances. To improve Fuse's usability, Cluster Charges will be able to be deployed on Deployable Shields and Osa's Talon-8 Shields, providing new strategic possibilities for players to find and utilize.\n\n### Y8S3 - SHOTGUNS\n\nWe'll also be reworking all shotguns in Y8S3 (excluding the BOSG 12, TCSG12, and ACS12) with the goal of bringing more consistency to the weapon type. This change will make aiming down sights more rewarding, while decreasing the effectiveness of hip-fire. You can find more in-depth information on this change [here](https://rainbow6.com/designersnotes/y8s3).\n\n### Y8S4 - SHIELD REWORK\n\nWe want shield operators to feel strong, while taking away the feeling of powerlessness when facing off against them; In a one-on-one situation, a player should feel that they have a chance against a shield operator, and on the other side, a shield operator should not be bullied without consequence or risk. Changes such as removing hip-fire while the shield is out will help to remove frustrations on both sides of the battle, and reinforce the idea that with a team around them, a shield operator can be a true force to be reckoned with.\n\n### YEAR 9 - AZAMI'S KIBA BARRIER\n\nKiba Barriers have allowed Azami to become one of the strongest operators in the defender lineup, giving her the ability to control areas and create angles which are difficult for opponents to deal with and see. We'll be making changes to decrease the robustness of her gadget and to give attackers the option to play more aggressively against her. Once these changes are ready, we'll be testing and evaluating them with community feedback, ensuring that they are effective and balanced.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nCommunity concerns are our concerns: we are refactoring and making proactive changes behind the scenes to answer the feedback you are sharing with us to make siege this unique tactical shooter experience we all enjoy.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege"],"readTime":7,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/dnwatjKhLBCgGuHopFmls/classified-balancing-team-year-8-and-beyond","date":"2023-08-22T16:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1589JIZN3Llr2uizo0hs9N","title":"“I may not have a family, but I have Redhammer.” – Ram","abstract":"Break through to the other side in Operation HEAVY METTLE, where nothing can stand against the unstoppable force that is our newest attack Operator: Bo-Ram Choi.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3ToiYMR4ivAYRQnXybI3ZW/b38d1236f752046c01f28fc0ccff3369/Y8S3_HeavyMettle_OperatorKeyart.jpg","content":"Break through to the other side in Operation HEAVY METTLE, where nothing can stand against the unstoppable force that is our newest attack Operator: Bo-Ram Choi. \n\nJoining the REDHAMMER team, Ram is just as relentless as she is protective of her team, and nothing speaks to these qualities more than the newest device she brings to the field The BU-GI AUTO BREACHER.

We are aware of the situation and the issues behind it.\\\nIana's high presence is mainly driven by her access to Frag Grenades, while Warden's high presence relates to the strength of 1.5x sights on Defender loadouts. The Community's sentiments over this topic are in alignment with ours. These operators need changes, and we will take action in an upcoming mid-season patch to make sure they feel less like \"must picks\" and more like weighted choices within a squad's lineup.\n\nThis mid-season patch adjustment is aimed at allowing more operator diversity in matches in the short term, but we are working in parallel on a bigger solution that will attend the balance situation of Frag Grenades and the 1.5x sight within Siege. Both elements are widespread through our lineup of operators, and we know that shuffling them around is not a sustainable solution, that is why we are taking the time to polish a more substantial set of changes that should open up more balancing options allowing us to make less \"binary\" changes in the future.\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n### FUZE\n\n#### CLUSTER CHARGE\n\n-   Can be deployed on Deployable Shields and Talon Shields\n\nNow that Fuze can deploy the Cluster Charge on reinforcements, we will also allow him to do it on Deployable shields and Talon Shields. It is a small change but will create a new synergy between Fuze and Osa, allowing the use of his charges in places that weren't possible before. Though there is a cost. As with any other bulletproof glass, the Cluster Charge will shatter the shields when the drilling is successful.\n\n### ZERO\n\n#### ARGUS CAMERA\n\n-   Can pierce through Deployable Shields and Talon Shields.\n\nThis change won't have a huge impact on matches, but it will bring consistency to the rules of piercing, if the gadget can get through reinforcements, it should also be capable of piercing Deployable and Talon Shields. Since the piercing action of the Argus Camera cannot shatter Mira's Black Mirror, then the same rule applies to shields, so they won't shatter either.\n\n### GRIM\n\n#### KAWAN HIVE LAUNCHER\n\n-   Switch Ability Mode to Sticky (default) or Bouncy\n\nOne of the main weaknesses of Grim is the need to have line of sight with the location you want to activate the Hive in. With this update, we are introducing a new firing mode to address this. From now on, Grim can select if the projectile will stick or bounce after touching a surface. This adds to all the changes done in the previous season and will help you to apply the effect on your target.\n\n### LESION\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Gadget refill timer Reduced to 20 seconds (from 30)\n-   Max resources Increased to 9 mines (from 8)\n\n#### GU MINE\n\n-   Gadget type is now Mechanical (unaffected by EMPs)\n-   Initial damage Increased to 5hp (from 0)\n-   Poison damage Increased to 12hp (from 8)\n-   Poison timer Reduced to 2 seconds (from 2.5)\n-   Cloaking removed\n-   HUD Icon removed\n-   Stepping on a GU Mine while being affected by another will reset the Poison timer and deal the Poison damage instantly.\n-   Added Area of Effect feedback\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Super Shorty as a secondary weapon option\n\nDying because of something invisible is a source of frustration and is why we removed the initial damage from the GU mine at the beginning of Year 5. But this change also removed a situation we've been trying to recover for some time: the fear of stepping on multiple mines in a row.\n\nWe have reintroduced the initial damage and made stepping on multiple mines a bit spicier. If you are already poisoned by a GU mine and trigger another, you will receive the initial damage and an instant tick of poison damage from the one already on your foot, so you will need to be more careful. These 2 changes turn the mines into a threat again. We are also tweaking some extra values, like the poison damage and the timer, to make removing the nail more urgent.\n\nBecause of these changes we have decided to remove the cloaking completely, making GU mines always visible. This should eliminate the frustration and increase the skill ceiling, as you will need to look for good locations to place your mines. This also removes the only electronic part of the device, so IQ won't be able to detect them, and Brava won't be able to hack them.\n\n## GADGET BALANCING\n\n### DEPLOYABLE SHIELD\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Bulletproof Glass: Hitting the shield with a melee will shatter the glass windows.\n\nWe have taken the opportunity to update the Shattered Glass System for Deployable Shields along with the changes to Fuze. If the shield receives a melee hit, the glass of the windows will be shattered.\n\n## WEAPON BALANCING\n\n### SHOTGUNS\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Every shotgun excluding the BOSG 12, TCSG12 and ACS12 have had the following changes.\n-   Ranges are normalized into 3 stages.\n\n-   0-5 meters, each pellet deals 100% of the base damage\n-   6-10 meters , each pellet deals 75% of the base damage\n-   13 meters and above, each pellet deals 45% of the base damage\n\n-   Headshot modifier: A pellet getting the headshot modifier deals 1.5x the damage after its range modifier.\n-   Hip fire spread has been revisited and redistributed across the board.\n-   Shooting while aiming down sight results in a tighter spread across the board. Note that this effect is not new, just being increased to reward players when aiming down sights.\n-   Moving increases the spread.\n\nThis is a big pass on every classical shotgun in the game. With these changes we are adding consistency and something you can learn. Ranges are normalized and based on the average kill distance in the game as well as the m590A1, which we know is a favorite at this time. The goal here is to reward good practices such as aiming for the head or holding angles. These changes are aimed at making shotguns less spray and pray, and more worthy as an option without removing what is currently working.\n\n## PLAYLIST ECOSYSTEM UPDATE\n\n### QUICK MATCH\n\nAs announced during the year 8 reveal, we started to look at how we could change Quick Match to make it much more... well \"Quick.\" We realized that we needed to make tweaks to other playlists for this new Quick Match to fit.\n\n#### BASE CHANGES\n\n-   Action phase reduced to 165s (from 180).\n-   Operator pick phase duration reduced to 20s (from 30). Additionally, if the round did not involve a role swap, the operator pick phase is reduced to 15s.\n-   Preparation phase reduced to 30s (from 45).\n-   Objective locations are automatically revealed for attackers at the start of the round.\n-   Clearance Level availability increased to CL 10\n-   We have made some tweaks to the matchmaking algorithm for Quick Match to find matches quicker.\n-   We will be applying a soft reset to the casual skill level algorithm to bring everyone closer together, which should result in finding matches even faster.\n\nWe are also taking this chance to implement 2 new concepts to the Quick Match playlist: __Pre-Setups__ and the __Attacker Safeguard__\n\n__PRE-SETUPS__\n\nFor every map in the map pool, we have designed 2 sets of pre-setups for every bombsite (this new feature is bomb exclusive) which include a number of pre-deployed reinforcements on the map as well as pre-placed rotations and holes.\\\nThese new pre-setups will allow defenders to jump into the action right away without having to worry about reinforcing the entire site.\n\n__ATTACKER SAFEGUARD__\n\nAttackers in Quick Match will no longer have to worry about possible spawn peaks or runouts at the beginning of the round as we are implementing 10 seconds of invulnerability at the start of the Action Phase (for attackers only). An attacker will become vulnerable again after those 10 seconds __or if that attacker enters the building__. This way, attackers will be able to approach the building without having to check every window.\n\nWe are also extending the already known \"Red Walls\" for 10 additional seconds to keep defenders from exiting the building while the attackers are making their approach.\n\nThese changes are aimed at making Quick Match a place in Rainbow Six: Siege that allows you to jump straight into the action and jump out to another match. We want players to feel that they can have their R6 fix easier, without having to worry about the basic and repetitive actions of a normal Siege match.\n\nAdditionally, we wanted to address the fact that some of the more classic maps in the casual map pool will not be included in the new Quick Match. We know that losing access to these maps can be frustrating and we will actively work towards adding them back to the map pool as soon as they are ready with their own new pre-setups.\n\n### STANDARD (PREVIOUSLY UNRANKED)\n\nPart of this update includes changing what was previously Unranked and giving it a new identity inside Rainbow Six: Siege. With the Quick Match updates, we were losing a place in the game to experience a core Siege match outside of the Ranked environment, that's why we decided to shift Unranked into what we now call the \"Standard\" playlist.\n\nStandard will now also be the recommended playlist for new players coming into the game.\n\n#### BASE CHANGES\n\n-   Removal of Operator and Map ban phases.\n-   Overtime rounds changed to 1 (from 3).\n-   Clearance Level availability changed to CL 0.\n-   We are renaming the competitive cluster to \"Tactical\" in order to better inform players about the type of playlists that can be found inside.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":null,"readTime":10,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2Btj0mP7e7gVKIODGSLuiX/y8s3-designers-notes","date":"2023-08-13T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"hmLtXQucpD05WszOadhAO","title":"Y8S2 Mid-Season Roadmap Update","abstract":"Check out what's coming to Rainbow Six Siege in the Y8S2 Mid-Season Roadmap Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/17BpR9amZDVbV8xlGp7Mhb/c5587b8f52be4cfc4afa0944bf1eedd2/Y8S2_Midseason_Roadmap_Update.png","content":"Each season, as we introduce new content, we are also providing an updated Roadmap to ensure transparency on upcoming features.

Multiple changes will be coming into effect, leading to exciting new improvements and more accurate Reputation Standings for players. \n\n### WHAT WE'RE CHANGING\n\nWe have rebalanced the way we account for various actions in the system, ultimately affecting how easy it is to attain the highest Standings of Esteemed and Exemplary. \n\nWe have also made changes to certain measures that affect when penalties will be triggered. With the new updates, the point at which a player triggers a penalty will be more consistent.\n\n### HOW WILL THIS AFFECT PLAYERS\n\n- After this update, players' Reputation Standings may have changed. Playing fairly and respecting others is key to helping raise a player's Standing.\n\n- Repeat offenders may rapidly trigger a penalty. Avoiding further disruptive actions will be vital to maintaining a good Standing.\n\n## TO SUMMARIZE\n\nWith this major rebalancing, many players will be seeing a change in their Reputation Standing, with some disruptive players also accelerating the triggering of penalties. This is a deliberate result of our latest Reputation System update. We're working to ensure that this system works well for all players, and we know that with the efforts of our community, together, we can build a great experience for everyone . \n\nThe Reputation System remains in its Beta phase and will keep on evolving as we move forward. In the future, we will be bringing greater visibility and control to players and additional ways for you to interact with one another in prosocial ways. \n\nWe remain committed to ensuring a safe environment for all players.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","toxicity","dev-blogs"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1MwSYw0xxnbncvKzgdhJZS/reputation-system-beta-system-balancing","date":"2023-07-26T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"2HyWwS7OTwTKx3q8CZ7auZ","title":"Y8S2.3 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S2.3","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7EB8njQeeD4HxP0H99NTZj/7e5b96fb4089439e51e5901c2584c1cd/Y8S2.3_PatchNotes.960x540.png","content":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S2.3.\n\n## Y8S2.3 Patch Size\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 1.12GB\n- Steam: 1.5 GB\n- Xbox One: 1.36 GB\n- Xbox Series X: 1.64 GB\n- PS4: 1.65 GB\n- PS5: 1.57 GB\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING \n\n### VIGIL\n\n-   Vigil will share the same glitching behavior as Nøkk.\n-   The ERC-7 Video Disruptor will not be deactivated when performing certain actions, such as shooting, and instead will trigger the glitch effect on cameras.\n-   Vigil won't be immune to Lion's EE-ONE-D and Grim's Kawan Hive.

She can become invisible to observation tools and at the same time mute her footsteps. She is leading some of the main frustration for defenders and we would like to tackle this. In a quiet environment everyone should be able to hear someone else approaching, and Nøkk's ability to move silently breaks this rule. We've decided to remove the silent facet of the ability in exchange for increased ability duration.\"\n\n### VIGIL\n\n__ERC-7__\n\n-   On observation tools Vigil will share the same glitching effect as Nøkk.\n-   The ability won't deactivate while performing certain actions, like shooting, and will instead trigger the glitch effect on observation tools.\n-   Vigil won't be immune to Lion's EE-ONE-D or Grim's Kawan Hive. Both gadgets will detect him, but he can prevent being pinged down by activating the ERC-7.\n\nNøkk and Vigil share a similar ability, and in the pursuit of consistency, we've decided to extend Nøkk's cloaking rules to Vigil. With this change Vigil will glitch on observation tools while performing actions like shooting, deploying a gadget or sprinting. These new interactions will reward players that proceed more carefully while using the ERC-7 and will punish those who act more careless.\n\n### ORYX\n\n__Hatch Climb__\n\n-   Reduced hatch climb interaction time by 30%.\n\nOur game data shows that Oryx does not profit much from his ability to climb hatches. We would like to make this interaction smoother by reducing its recovery time, now it should feel less dangerous to perform.\n\n---\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["community"],"readTime":3,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/35sHyBXl9SbG9hiIL6cnQZ/y8s23-designers-notes","date":"2023-07-06T13:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"5PnOXwp69RWHaeN0EoDmZF","title":"Reputation System Beta: Status Update – July 2023","abstract":"What we’ve done and will be doing with the Reputation System Beta.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6yeNSdaqJdAkWmR18lGy2s/21a89891025bf931733e6a3033437aa0/Reputation.System.Update.960x540.png","content":"## DURING Y8S1\n\n### PLAYER STANDING STABILITY\n\nSince the release of the Reputation System Beta, we've made several shadow updates to not only improve the foundations of the Reputation System, but also the stability of player Standings and this has continued throughout Y8S1.  During Y8S1, we made further changes to ensure that the occurrence and severity of a player's negative actions align with an equally severe impact on a player's Standing. We want players to have confidence in the system, so while adjusting the effects that certain actions have on a player's Reputation Standing, our goal is to make sure that Standings don't change match to match, time after time. As well as this, it's crucial that Standing changes are still happening when warranted and that the presence of the system is felt by abusers.\n\n### ADDITIONAL DETECTIONS\n\nWe are now tracking additional conditions to help increase our knowledge of players' disruptive actions. One such high-impact example of this is a player instigated crashes that are indicative of DDOS attacks. Being able to track a wider range of actions completed by a player such as DDOS, text abuse, leaving matches, and more, has allowed us to build a more robust overview of a player, enabling us to take more appropriate actions to mitigate abuse, and to help foster a more positive experience for all.\n\n### ACTION HISTORY\n\nIn the early days of the Reputation System, we were looking at a limited time period when deciding whether to give a penalty. This was due both to a limitation of the system and a desire to ensure that only the worst of the worst offenders would be receiving penalties. In the time since, the Reputation System has become more robust, and we have seen a great response to reputation penalties. Because of this, we have updated the ranges over which the system checks for negativity. The result of this longer and more dynamic 'memory' of the Reputation System is that the system will be more accurate in delivering penalties to a larger group of offending players and will make bypassing the system more difficult.\n\n## Y8S2 AND ONWARD\n\n### IN-MATCH PENALTY VISUALS\n\nIn Operation Dread Factor, we've made numerous quality of life changes to help players more clearly understand when and what penalties are active and more.\n\n__Y8S2 Updates__\n\n- Activation banner appears on the first round rather than every round\n\n- Active Penalty Banner renamed to Penalties from Warnings\n\n- Active Penalty banner disappears shortly after a round begins\n\n- Active Penalty icons remain for match duration.\n\n- Penalty pop-ups will appear when returning to the main menu. If a pop-up was missed, it will appear after launching the game.\n\n### Looking Forward\n\nAs we move forward with the Reputation System, we will continue to release updates in multiple areas. The Y8S2 update has already brought UI improvements for the reputation penalties and as we progress, we will continue to perform systemwide rebalancing as needed. In Y8S3 we will be introducing several new features that aim to improve players' insight into their Reputation Standing and create new opportunities to interact. We continue to be focused on delivering on our core goal of improving player experience in Rainbow Six Siege.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","anti-cheat"],"readTime":3,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5PnOXwp69RWHaeN0EoDmZF/reputation-system-beta-status-update-july-2023","date":"2023-07-05T16:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"3OjUdY5s7KG9atPnXYucXK","title":"Classified: Player Protection Updates - Year 8 and beyond","abstract":"What we're doing to protect players in Year 8 and beyond.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/79kqLiDw3o93uO1X0mia2w/076923d937fb38a67db863b66572fa66/Classified_header_960x540.v2.png","content":"## A YEAR IN REVIEW \n\nOne of the top complaints of PvP shooter players across the entire genre is cheating and toxic behavior. In the space of a single session, one cheater can ruin the experience for hundreds if not thousands of players. Over the last 12 months, Rainbow Six Siege and its Player Protection team have reoriented the way we think and develop features to address this challenge. This has led to the development of two industry-first systems, which we call MouseTrap and QB. These two systems have already had an enormous positive impact on the health of our game. Research and development undertaken has resulted in a suite of current and planned initiatives that are bringing creative and sometimes counter-intuitive solutions to problems that have plagued PvP shooter fans for years. \n\nThis isn't the end of the journey, but the start. Player protection is a never-ending battle and arms race, but our belief on the Siege development team is that this is one of the most important places to innovate --- both as a game, and as an industry. \n\nBelow we will share some of our learnings from these two systems, as well as updates in our Reputation System, and give some insight into how our players are driving our choices and about some of the new initiatives we are working on for the coming year.  \n\nThe Player Protection team on Rainbow Six Siege has worked diligently to address the feedback from our community and ensure transparency along the way. \n\n## RECENT RELEASES \n\n### MouseTrap\n\nMouseTrap has been live for close to 3 months now. This feature launched mid-season with Operation Commanding Force (Y8S1.2 update) on April 11, 2023. We wanted to give you a brief update on how it's going and what we have learned. \n\nMouseTrap is a new detection system which penalizes the use of Mouse and Keyboard on console by adding extra input latency (or lag) to players detected, encouraging them to switch back to using their controller. Our objective is to restore a true balance between competition and skill to improve fair play in Rainbow Six Siege. \n\nWe are very satisfied with MouseTrap's detection capabilities so far. We expected to see a moderate reduction in the number of spoofers at launch with preliminary results estimated at 30% to 50%. However, the data we've gathered has surpassed these expectations and has shown a major reduction in the amount of Mouse and Keyboard users on consoles.  \n\nThere has been a __78% reduction in the total spoofers (Mouse and Keyboard users) detected__ __in Rainbow Six Siege__. If we look at __Ranked on its own, the reduction is similar; 73% fewer spoofers than before__.  \n\n![[R6S] Classified: Player Protection July 2023 - MnKUsageChart](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3gxRRG3kb75iYn7Iqp9vUI/71896ec060ec619b388539672c3c3d60/MnKUsageChart.960x540.png)\n\nWhen first we announced this feature, many were wondering why we chose to penalize Mouse and Keyboard users instead of banning them. We wanted to give these players the chance to change their behavior and play fairly. Today, we are able to confirm that this approach and new system has indeed contributed to a behavioral change: once detected by MouseTrap, many users are returning to their controllers or switching to PC. Our data shows that after a first penalty, 43% of penalized players will continue to play the game without ever getting any further penalties.  \n\nIf you've been hesitant to play Ranked on console before or if you're thinking of returning to the game after some time away, now is the perfect time to give it a try as this means there are fewer Mouse and Keyboard players on console now than at any time in the last few years.  \n\nWe are dedicated to ensuring fairness in Rainbow Six Siege and are aware of current community concerns with MouseTrap. We are currently working to deploy a fix for the reported issue as soon as possible.\n\n### QB\n\nReleased on November 8, 2022, QB is one of our latest PC anti-cheat features which aims to make cheat development more tedious. We've seen great results from this system which has already contributed to the ban of over 10 000 cheaters, and we are only getting started! We've also been made aware that several cheat vendors have stopped creating cheats for Siege following this update and have been getting a lot of positive feedback from our community regarding their in-game experience since the deployment of this feature. We are, however, continuously monitoring this system to identify opportunities for improvement.  \n\n### Reputation Penalties\n\nReducing in-game toxicity has been a major focus for our Player Protection team this year, both in terms of abuse around friendly fire and unwanted communications. Since March 8, 2023, players who engage in voice chat abuse after two warnings receive a penalty and have their voice chat muted to others by default for the next 30 matches. This penalty is complementary to the written chat penalty introduced in the game in Year 7 on October 2022.   \n\nBoth penalties aim to reduce unwanted communication and the impact of offenders by informing these players, via a set of in-game warnings and feedback, of how they are perceived by others for them to change and adapt their behavior before they get sanctioned by the game. The data gathered so far on this feature indicate that the addition of those penalties has indeed contributed to reducing toxicity in Rainbow Six Siege: __half of the players who received a first warning for Voice or Written chat abuse have been dissuaded from continuing to abusing it__.   \n\nThis is also reflected in our first Reputation Penalty around reverse friendly fire, which aims to reduce cases associated with recidivists who injure too many teammates by abusing certain mechanism across several matches. \n\nLooking to Year 9, the Reputation System will continue to evolve. We'll be working to add further sources that we can use to help increase the coverage of the system and ultimately safeguard player safety and enjoyment. \n\n![[R6S] Classified: Player Protection July 2023 - WarningsBarChart.v2](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4rTSWrp07KjMSj0mfzJZLL/ac12e01aa3cf9b0894dfcb1d5e439c19/WarningsBarChart.v2.960x540.png)\n\n## COMING UP IN YEAR 8 \n\nWe are committed to ensuring a safe environment and fair experience for all players, many features are currently being developed to reinforce players' protection and will be released throughout Year 8.  \n\n__[New] Player Commendation System -__ The Player Commendation System is a new appreciative system that will be made available in Y8S3 (Autumn 2023). With this feature, we want to reinforce and encourage positivity in our community by allowing players to recognize others at the end of a match based on their experience. \n\n__[Update] Reputation System -__ The Reputation System will get several updates this year. Y8S2 has already brought Reputation Penalty UI improvements and we will continue to support the system with ongoing rebalancing. In both Y8S3 & Y8S4, we will be introducing new features which will help players to better understand their Reputation Standing and while also bringing additional opportunities to interact with this system. \n\n__[New] Privacy Mode on Console -__ Privacy Mode, a feature to help protect streamers and players who are looking for additional privacy in-game was made available on PC last year with Y7S2 Operation Vector Glare and will be coming to console before the end of Year 8.  \n\n__[Update] Ranked Requirements -__ Phone number validation has seen a successful implementation, though our work protecting Ranked continues. During Year 8 & 9, we will be taking the first steps to start a new foundation in safeguarding the competitive integrity of the game. As part of this, we will be bringing multiple new measures which will also aim to address smurfing. Crucially, we'll be reinforcing these foundations with new initiatives throughout Year 9. Not only will this support our current Anti-Cheat efforts, but it will also encourage returning players to rediscover Siege before jumping into competition, therefore improving the ranked experience for all players. More information about this update will be revealed later this year. \n\nStay tuned during the rest of Year 8 and beyond to discover more updates to make Rainbow Six Siege fair and safe for everyone.

Inspired by community artists such as Sunstark, he began posting Siege-related fanart in July of 2018. From this date, Shaun rapidly honed his artistic skills, leading to many opportunities. He collaborated on multiple occasions with Ubisoft, from having an early look at Flores to create a promotional fanart, to being a part of the Siege Champions program, and finally working on a bundle for Mute!\n\nShaun uses thick outlines and line art to create his bold, colorful artwork. He gets his inspirations from comic books and expressive artwork with movement and weight.\n\nAs a queer individual, Shaun wanted to represent the LGBTQ+ community in his bundle. He pulled inspiration from the artist Tom of Finland, who had a large influence on the late 20th century gay culture. Many symbols of the queer community have been included in this bundle, from the leather biker cap to the transgender symbol. Shaun was also influenced by the punk movement and used some of its distinctive symbols - spikes and chains, slogans of resistance, graffiti and spray paint motifs - to represent the LGBTQ+ community's resistance to oppression and persecution.\n\nThere's also a distinct clash of art styles reflecting his identity as a Chinese-American artist. We can note the Chinese expression present on the weapon skin that can be translated to \"Paint the dragon, dot the eyes\"; it is taken from a story which meaning refers to the lack of one small element from the creation that would make it perfect. Shaun is a very driven artist, but he likes this story to remind himself: even when the perfect detail seems to evade him, he can still look back and be proud of what he accomplished.\n\nToday, Shaun is leaving his mark on Rainbow Six Siege with this bundle and the symbols incorporated in it, making it a very meaningful and personal representation of who he is.\n\nDon't forget to have a look at Shaun's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/notamutemain) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/notamutemain/) accounts to see more of his incredible art!\n\n![[R6S] - Y8S2 Artist Bundle - Prime Gaming Asset](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4oLdtHome6InTnlJdCNgtm/d332f18748ea446579faedfe7c58793b/Y8S2_ArtistBundle_Primegaming_Asset.jpg)\n\n### FAQ\n\n__What is the Community Artist Bundle Program?__\n\nThe Community Artist Bundle Program launched in Y6S1 and it brings operator bundles created by some of our most talented and dedicated Siege fan artists into the game.\n\n__I'm a Siege fan artist too - what can I do to get selected as well?__\n\nGiven the length of our production cycle for in-game content, the fan artists for Year 8 have already been determined.

Once deployed, it creates a digital barrier that blocks vision from any Observation Tool, such as drones, Iana's Gemini Replicator, or Brava's Kludge Drone, so operators or gadgets cannot be spotted through it. This barrier is only visible from Observation Tools, so it won't affect operators in any way. The arms of the device will adapt to the space available, so the projection won't go through walls.\n\nCurrently, the only way to deny Attacker droning is by playing Mute, Mozzie, or Solis. The Observation Blocker will now also fulfill this role to a lesser degree, as drones can travel through the barrier with zero penalty. This gadget won't replace those operators, but it will reinforce the gameplay around denying information and allow for more flexibility when a dedicated operator is not required.\n\nDuring the Preparation Phase, the device can be used to hide information regarding the operators selected or the actual defensive setup. Attackers will need to take more risks with drones to use Attacker Repick at its full potential as they won't know if a Defender is watching from behind the wall. It can also be used to force Attackers to be more accurate when gathering information, as any corner covered by an Observation Blocker can hide a threat.\n\n__OPERATORS__\n\nThe Observation Blocker is added as a 3rd secondary gadget option unless it is specified in the Operator Balancing section below.\n\n-   Ela\n-   Rook\n-   Warden\n-   Caveira\n-   Kaid\n-   Maestro\n-   Pulse\n-   Alibi\n-   Jäger\n\n# OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n## ALIBI\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Deployable Shield\n-   Removed Impact Grenades.\n-   Added Observation Blocker\n-   Added Proximity Alarm.\n\nAlibi's Prisma blocks line of sight, gathers intel, and tricks attackers. We want to double down on this fantasy by changing all her secondary gadgets to focus on those aspects.\n\nThe Observation Blocker will contribute to the mind games around the Prismas allowing you to hide them from drones to be more effective against Attackers. Proximity Alarms as an alternative, will gather intel and contribute to map control.\n\nThe removal of Impact Grenades will also help slow her down, as she will have to rely on the Baliff 410 to make all rotations.\n\n## CLASH\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Added Deployable Shield.\n\nTo compensate for her limited fire power Clash will now be able to contribute more to the site setup. Similarly, to what was done with the Super Shorty, we wanted to give her more options.\n\n## GOYO\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Nitro Cell.\n-   Added Bulletproof Camera.\n-   Added Impact Grenades.\n\nGoyo already has a lot of area denial with the Volcan Canisters, having access to the Nitro Cell fulfills a similar the similar gameplay intention of plant denial. We will replace it with a Bulletproof Camera, so he has an alternative to gather intel and protect his gadgets from being spotted or destroyed by various drones.\n\nWe will also give him Impact Grenades as a 3rd option to again encourage flexibility, so you can trigger a couple of Volcan Canisters without needing to have direct line of sight with them.\n\n## GRIM\n\n__KAWAN HIVE LAUNCHER__\n\n-   Equip time: Reduced to 1 second (from 1.1).\n-   Rate of fire: Increased to 70 rpm (from 40). \n\n__KAWAN HIVE__\n\n-   Activation: Time reduced to 0.4 seconds (from 1).\n-   Vulnerabilities: It is also vulnerable to bullets, laser, and melee damage.\n\n__HIVE__\n\n-   Duration: Increased to 16 seconds (from 8).\n-   Size: Radius increased to 4.6 meters (from 3.6).\n-   Detection system: Now detects any part of the body, not only the head.\n-   Decay: Duration reduced to 4 seconds (from 9). The time between pings is normalized to 1 second (from 1/3/9).\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Added Baliff 410 as a secondary weapon option.\n-   Added Hard Breach Charge as a secondary gadget option.\n\nTo make Grim's gadget more impactful, we will tweak some values with the objective of increasing the chances of applying the effect to a Defender.\n\nFirst, we are making the Kawan Hive Launcher more responsive by reducing the equipping time and increasing the rate of fire, so you can fill up an area much faster. Secondly, the Kawan Hive will release its charge faster, so a well-placed projectile will easily catch defenders nearby. But take note a quick enough defender can still destroy it before this happens as the Kawan Hive is now vulnerable to more damage types. Finally, we are increasing the Hive's radius and duration, so it can better limit the Defender's movements, as a result the effect's decay will be reduced to make it less punishing to touch the area by accident.\n\nWe will also improve his loadout to increase its flexibility and allow for more creative ways to use the launcher.\n\nWe believe these changes will help him, but other options are being explored as these changes may not be enough to put him in line with other attackers, so more adjustments will come.\n\n## JÄGER\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Barbed Wire.\n-   Added Observation Blocker.\n\nThe Observation Blocker has great synergy with operators like Jäger that need to hide their utility from unwanted eyes.\n\n## PULSE\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Barbed Wire.\n-   Added Deployable Shield\n-   Added Observation Blocker.\n\nIt's difficult to compete with the Nitro Cell paired with Pulse's ability, but the Deployable Shield and Observation Blocker can be interesting if you want to play more passively, as they can provide you with some protection while feeding information to your teammates.\n\n## SMOKE\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Deployable Shield.\n-   Added Proximity Alarm.\n\nSmoke is the one to go to when somebody asks for area denial. Even if he's not the optimal option in every situation, his loadout makes him consistently viable and useful. Without the deployable shield, we expect the decision won't be as easy and will leave some space for other area denial defenders.\n\n## TACHANKA\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Added Proximity Alarm.\n\nThe Proximity Alarms will give Tachanka precise information about where to shoot his Incendiary Grenades and help him use resources more effectively.\n\n## THUNDERBIRD\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n-   Removed Impact Grenades\n-   Removed Nitro Cell\n-   Added Barbed Wire\n-   Added Bulletproof Camera\n\n__KONA STATION__\n\n-   Cooldown: Reduced to 15 seconds (from 35).\n-   Healing: Reduced to 20 hp (from 30).\n\nWe want to make playing on top of a Kona Station fairer. On Consoles, where headshots are less likely, you may end up fighting against a defender that has +30hp because the automatic heal will trigger on the first tick of damage received. However, we are reducing the cooldown to get heals, so the Kona Station will be available more often when a Defender needs it and will reward staying there to fully heal, as the healing potential over time is higher than before.\n\nAdditionally, Thunderbird was released with a very strong loadout that encourages very aggressive play. We want to reduce her killing potential by removing the Nitro Cell and make the shotgun a meaningful option by removing her Impact Grenades. We will replace them with support focused gadgets that we believe fit her role better.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\nTry out the latest Siege updates on the Test Server and don't hesitate to report any bugs or issues you encounter on the [new and improved R6Fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/projects/RAINBOW6-SIEGE-TS).\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["patch-notes"],"readTime":8,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/42o6BhsFgmPla9wmiJ5GnJ/y8s2-designers-notes","date":"2023-05-15T13:50:00.000Z"},{"id":"4m8fjcmROM4IJSNi58ZEM7","title":"“Fear is a teacher.

FENRIR, our newest Defender, brings his valuable expertise in Operation DREAD FACTOR. Hailing from Uppsala in Sweden, Fenrir joins the REDHAMMER squad. Being first through the door teaches a valuable lesson in fight or flight.\n\nFENRIR brings the F-NATT DREAD MINE as part of his arsenal. Releasing a fear-inducing gas, FENRIR brings a good area of denial ability when focused on gameplay planning. With 2 HEALTH, 2 SPEED, and the MP7 and SASG-12 as primary weapon choices, FENRIR leaves his opponents feeling like deer caught in headlights. With BARBED WIRE and BULLETPROOF CAMERAS as gadget options, you'll never be sure if you're being watched.\n\nThe F-NATT DREAD MINE is a throwable device that sticks to walls, so it can be hidden in places where fear can fester. FENRIR comes equipped with 5 mines and can activate 3 at a time anywhere on the map, so you'll never know when your resolve will leave you. When a mine goes off it limits the target's field of vision, giving FENRIR and his teammates an advantage over their fear-stricken opponents. Attack Operators can rely on ZERO'S ARGUS CAMERA LAUNCHER to find the mines safely, or BRAVA'S KLUDGE DRONE to turn the fear back on the enemy.\n\nStudying Neurochemistry, FENRIR was discharged from the Swedish Armed forces when he proposed a project to create formulas that alter a soldiers' emotional state, so DEIMOS approached him to fund his research. When he learned his work was being turned into a dangerous weapon, FENRIR escaped and sought out Rainbow.\n\nFear is his greatest tool, and his first lesson will be terrifying.\n\nCheck him out on the Test Servers starting May 15th.
