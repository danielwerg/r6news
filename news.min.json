We want to make sure the worldwide launch of the Siege Cup goes as smoothly as it can for players to experience what is now the closest you can get to playing Siege like the pros. 😎\n\nFor players eligible for the Beta phase (PC) - here are the guidelines:\n\n-  Assemble your squad. __A player can only join one team and no changes to teams will be possible after registering__. All members of a Squad need to be at least Clearance Level 50 and also need to have played more than 10 Ranked matches prior to the tournament.\n\n-  __Identify your Squad Leader, as only they have to register for your team.__ You can use the __*Promote to Leader functionality*__ by selecting your in-game profile from the top of the main menu, choosing a squad member, and pressing __*Promote to Leader*__. It is mandatory that your identified Squad leader is the one who gets accepted to the Siege Cup Beta__ and not another teammate.\n\n-   __Register here:__ [https://register.ubisoft.com/r6s-siegecupbeta](https://register.ubisoft.com/r6s-siegecupbeta)\n\n*Note that all participants' Reputation Standings will be considered and that cheaters will be excluded from the tournament.*\n\n*The Siege Cup will fully launch soon, with squad selection beginning in waves by the end of September!!* 🎉 \n\n__SIEGE CUP FAQ:__ [https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000109536](https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000109536)\n\n## The Competitive Coins are freshly out of the oven! \n\nThrough the Siege Cup and the Ranked playlist, __R6S competitive players are now able to get unpurchasable credits to access a collection of exclusive items or to redeem competitive packs__ 🎁.  \n\nFor the Siege Cup, the amount you earn is based on tiers and on final positions within the tournament. For Ranked, it will be added to Ranked rewards, which are based on your highest achieved Rank for a season and delivered at the beginning of the following one.  \n\n## The Phantom Player is coming in Y9S4! \n\nWhile we make sure to inform players as soon as improvements are ready to be integrated into Siege, we did share recently with the community some behind-the-scenes work via our latest Siege Intels update on Ranked 2.0. Live Content Director Christopher Budgen answered questions from players in a Q&A-style livestream, and __a major scoop emerged from that discussion__... 👀 \n\nThe Phantom Player is currently in development to enhance the experience of all Ranked players. In a nutshell, the Phantom Player is a mathematical value, a ''6th player'', which will __bring an extra layer of balancing to matchmaking__. Concretely, the Phantom Player sees the skill disparity between players of a stack and adds the appropriate skill value to even out the matches depending on the number of players within this stack.\n\n## There is much more cooking... \n\nThe Rainbow Six Siege team knows the importance of fairness for competitive players, and for almost 10 years now, we have been listening to your feedback and allocating significant resources to refining the experience.  \n\nWhen you have concerns, these become our concerns; we are looking closely into it to find the best innovative solutions that will serve your interest.

We had already explored various ideas and even approved some changes that were scheduled to begin production during Y7. However, due to other pressing priorities, her progress was consistently delayed. The purpose of this prototype was to prevent the current situation to happen. We intended to limit her initial strength while enhancing her potential by the end of the round, allowing for a snowball effect if played strategically. Unfortunately, given the current circumstances, this proposal isn't ideal anymore. Consequently, we've decided to focus on a more substantial change - one that addresses most of the existing issues and frustrations - for a future patch.\n\nIn the meantime, we believe that a small adjustment to her resource management could alleviate some of the frustration when playing against her and the ban rate. Specifically, preventing Dokkaebi from calling defenders immediately after spawning should help improve the overall perception.\n\n#### LOGIC BOMB\n\n- Initial charges: 0\n- Refill time: 45 seconds\n- Max. resources: 2\n\n### NØKK\n\nAs we previously mentioned, we have been actively exploring various ideas to enhance Nøkk's play style. After careful consideration, we decided to move away from the 'silent' approach. Our belief is that sound plays a pivotal role in Siege, and everyone should be able to rely on it consistently. Additionally, being silent tends to encourage to try luck sneaking up on opponents for surprise eliminations, which can be frustrating for the victim and not a very tactical approach.\n\nTherefore, we made the decision to enhance Nøkk's capabilities related to fake intel by reducing reliance on defensive intel tools. Now the ability gauge will only deplete when Nøkk performs an action that causes her glitch. This adjustment allows her to hold angles indefinitely without being detected, creating a deceptive sense of security for defenders as they navigate around the map. Instead of solely relying on going into the bomb site to take down targets, Nøkk will excel at cutting rotations and flank watching. This change will also allow Nøkk to push along a teammate without being worried about the ability running out, so will be easier take the defender by surprise if it was expecting a 1v1 situation.\n\nWe've also adjusted the ability values. On one hand, we've reduced the maximum resources because it now represents the time Nøkk can glitch with the ability active. The ability can be active throughout the entire round if she manages not to glitch. On the other hand, we've extended the time needed to refill the ability, making reckless consumption without good reason more punishing.\n\nWhile this change will impact all defensive cameras, Valkyrie is likely to be the most affected defender. This isn't due to the cameras being weaker, but rather because they now face another effective counter. Avoiding Evil Eyes and Bulletproof Cameras is relatively straightforward since they are easy to spot. However, Black Eyes are more challenging to avoid because their locations are often unknown, and it's likely that you will still be within their range when the ability expires.\n\n#### HEL PRESENCE REDUCTION\n\n- The ability does not deplete automatically upon activation. Only the time glitching consumes resources.\n- Max. resources: 10 seconds\n- Time for complete refill: 120 seconds\n- Min. resources to activate: 20%\n\n### SOLIS\n\nThis is our second wave of changes for Solis, this time we are focusing on her ability and the resource management. Solis should be able to fulfil the same strategies while being more taxing on the players attention to Solis resources.\n\nThere are three pillars behind this new wave of changes, the first one is the Detection Mechanic, we've tweaked the SPEC-IO detection area, now only the central area will detect gadgets and their identity will be hidden. This change aims to make players be more focused while using the ability, looking for gadgets require more time and attention.\n\nThe second pillar is the Scan Mechanic Rework, the Scan has become the Overclock Mode, when the Overclock Mode is activated the SPEC-IO energy is refilled and Solis will reveal the identity of every gadget that enters the central area. The Overclock mode has a limited amount of uses during the round, and once triggered it cannot be stopped. The Overclock mode introduces a new counter for Solis, while it is active every Enemy Observation Tool within Solis Detection range will receive a warning that alerts them about her presence. The rework of this mechanic adds more depth to Solis actions and will price players that choose the right moment to trigger the Overclock mode.\n\nThe Third Pillar is revisiting existing Balancing Levers, we would like to revert some of the changes that we did in Y9S2 that were aiming to limit the SPEC-IO power, we consider that this new set of changes gives more room to boost the minimum energy required to access the SPEC-IO while they are charging up during the round.\n\nThe new set of changes add a good amount of balancing levers that will allow us to tweak Solis power level in the future, we will monitor her performance and take actions if needed.\n\nThis update also provides indirect advantages for operators who were previously hard-countered by Solis, such as Glaz, Jackal, or Nøkk. Essentially, any attacker using a wearable device will find it easier to use them, as it will be more challenging to distinguish them from other electronic devices. To identify these operators, Solis will need to activate the Overclock mode, which can reveal her location to any nearby observation tool, making it a risky move. Additionally, operators with special drones, such as Twitch, Brava, or Flores, will also benefit from this change, as their utilities can remain unidentified until they have accomplished their objectives.\n\nAnother significant impact on the dynamics between Attackers and Defenders is the new approach to the Defuser. Without using the Overclock mode, Solis will be unable to determine 100% if the Defuser is being planted, giving attackers more opportunities to fake plants or assess the risks.\n\nOverall, the risk and reward of attempting to destroy unidentified gadgets can vary greatly, which implies a buff for a lot of operators.\n\n#### SPEC-IO ELECTRO-SENSOR\n\n- Base SPEC-IO Changes\n  - Only the center of the Screen will detect enemy gadgets.\n  - Gadgets will not show their identity until on Overclock Mode.\n  - Minimum required energy to use the SPEC-IO reduced to 50% (was 100%)\n- Scan Mechanic redesigned into Overclock Mode.\n- Overclock Mode will identify every gadget in the center of the screen.\n- Overclock Mode lasts for 10s.\n- Overclock Mode has 1 charge ability at the start of the round.\n  - A charge is added every 25s.\n  - Max Charges per match are 3.\n- During Overclock Mode the SPEC-IO will emit a Warning Signal.\n  - Only Observation Tools withing Solis detection range (12m) will see it.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n### CLAYMORE\n\nThe current delay between the enemy detection and the explosion provides defenders with ample time to either destroy the mine or even consider escaping from the blast. This is particularly noticeable when the Claymore is placed on windows, where enemies must vault and the operator's legs cannot touch the lasers until they are about to land.\n\nRemoving the delay would increase the risk for defenders attempting to destroy a well-placed mine or pre-fire it before their legs touch the lasers. Consequently, the Claymore would become more efficient for safeguarding flanks and would reward players who invest time in placing them properly.\n\n#### DETECTION SYSTEM\n\n- Removed delay between activation and explosion (from 0.2 seconds).\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Ace\n- Ash\n- Blackbeard\n- Brava\n- Capitão\n- Flores\n- Glaz\n- Grim\n- IQ\n- Jackal\n- Kali\n- Lion\n- Maverick\n- Osa\n- Sens\n- Striker\n- Thatcher\n- Twitch\n- Zero\n- Zofia\n\n### PROXIMITY ALARM\n\nWe've noticed an increase in player feedback concerning Sentry and the potent combination of the Nitro Cell with the Proximity Alarm, especially when players depend solely on the Proximity Alarm Scoring System to activate their pre-placed Nitro Cell from any location on the map.\n\nOur data analysis indicates that this tactic is not the most frequently chosen combination. Nonetheless, we recognize the potential frustration it can cause. Therefore, we have opted to remove the score given when an enemy triggers a Proximity Alarm. While Sentry can still utilize the sound cue to set off pre-placed Nitro Cells close to Proximity Alarms, the absence of scoring means he must depend solely on sound, which we consider to be a more fair interaction.\n\n#### SCORING\n\n- Removed the Scoring Award triggered when an enemy activates a Proximity Alarm.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Alibi\n- Castle\n- Caveira\n- Goyo\n- Mira\n- Rook\n- Oryx\n- Sentry\n- Skopós\n- Smoke\n- Solis\n- Tachanka\n- Tubarão\n- Wamai\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n### FMG-9\n\nThis season, Nøkk will undergo significant changes, and we aim to use this chance to reevaluate the FMG-9's recoil. Our goal is to enhance the weapon's reliability by ensuring it is more comfortable to maintain long bursts and by decreasing its horizontal recoil. These new recoil adjustments should make Nøkk more proficient in holding long angles, as the weapon will be much more manageable.\n\n#### RECOIL - PC\n\n- Reduced first kick.\n- Reduced horizontal recoil.\n- The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### RECOIL - CONSOLE\n\n- Reduced lateral recoil. \n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n- Nøkk\n- Smoke\n\n### R4-C\n\nOur intention when reducing the R4-C magazine size is to balance Ash's overall effectiveness and the number of gunfights she can engage in before needing to reload. A smaller magazine encourages more thoughtful ammo management, reduces sustained firepower, and limits the angles she can pre-fire. R4-C users will need to be more precise with their shots.\n\nAdditionally, this change distinguishes the R4-C from other options available---the G36C on Ash or the LMG-E on Ram---encouraging players to re-evaluate the advantages of each weapon and choose the one that best suits their needs.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n- Magazine: Reduced to 25 bullets (from 30).\n- Ammo: Kept with 6 magazines. Number of bullets reduced to 151 (from 181).\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n- Ash\n- Ram\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n![[R6S] Y9S3 Designer's Notes - Y9S2_Rank_Distribution_PC](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4NOlsNRLlvvnKpziGw6qYr/c42f38dbfd6777a983d25ecf38ba8ef0/Y9S2_Rank_Distribution_PC.png)\n\n![[R6S] Y9S3 Designer's Notes - Y9S2_Rank_Distribution_Console](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/bp5DgGYuDsti8EY4u1X3N/cd056a66792253667bb682424454841d/Y9S2_Rank_Distribution_Console.png)\n\n<hr>\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":10,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1P21T5Rllq7X72E0zSGpEG/y9s3-designers-notes","date":"2024-08-26T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1CcXWoxmM7OHwrntPmHOSs","title":"Y9S2 MID-SEASON ROADMAP UPDATE","abstract":"Check out what's coming to Rainbow Six Siege in the Y9S2 Mid-Season Roadmap Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2uFKnUih8RZtnZg0IdxC9Y/b62f26ae324f40ed26d05cf7a8ca94ca/Y9S2_Roadmap_Update.960x540.jpg","content":"Each season, we provide a Roadmap update to offer further insights into the development of upcoming features to ensure transparent communication with all players.

In response to this, we restructured our team in a way that would dedicate more resources to the challenges of cheating and Anti-Cheat. Our new team is now composed of multi-disciplinary expert developers with an increased field of expertise that has continued to ramp up since our last [Anti-Cheat Status Update](https://rainbowsix.com/AntiCheat_May24), and is dedicated to improving the cheating situation in Siege.\n\n### CORE STRATEGY - PROACTIVE & REACTIVE\n\nOur Anti-Cheat strategy can be split into two main parts: proactive and reactive protections.\n\n__Proactive protection__ includes measures which are taken ahead of time, some of which will have a future or longer-term impact. These will generally impact cheat creators more, leading to reductions in the availability of cheat software. Encryption and binary hardening are proactive measures, which work by securing the game and making the creation of cheat software more difficult. Our team will be using these proactive measures to disrupt cheat-makers, making cheats more difficult to maintain.\n\nWith our proactive protections having reduced the amount of cheat software available, our __reactive protections__ can now continue the journey. Reactive protections will cover the areas which tend to affect cheaters themselves, who again, will have less software to choose from. This is where BattlEye and the QB System step in, working again to disable cheats and ban illegitimate players.\n\nThe Anti-Cheat team is working to create new  innovative approaches to Anti-Cheat in both the __proactive and reactive__ areas by pursuing research and development. They will also be adding new data points and detections to our systems  as part of our range of reactive protections, including detections for abnormal gameplay behaviours.\n\n## PROACTIVE PROTECTION\n\n### ENCRYPTION - BINARY HARDENING\n\nAfter the beginning of Y9S1, we started work on an internal roadmap to update the game code base using __encryption and hardening techniques to enhance security__. We've made several hardening updates during Year 9 so far; however, this is a long-term strategy. While every security update that we make has the potential to help in the here and now, this work will hit ongoing and future cheat creation hardest, as it results in new cheats being harder to develop, increasing the barriers to entry. The resources that we are putting into encryption and binary hardening will set Siege's security foundations for the future.\n\n__ANALYZING UPDATES__\n\nThe changes introduced with encryption and binary hardening can however also work by disrupting cheat-makers, resulting in __unstable cheats after each season update__, patch, or hotfix. We closely analyse the time that it takes for cheats to get back online after each deployment while also monitoring in-game cheating reports. Such analysis helps the Anti-Cheat team to understand how an update has performed and which changes might have been the most impactful, helping us to measure the performance of such updates.\n\n__Y9S2 CHEATING INCREASE: WHAT WE'RE DOING__\n\n__Some cheats came back online more quickly than expected after the launch of Y9S2, resulting in a surge of cheating early on__. We also measured an increase in cheater reports during this time, indicating that players were coming into contact with cheaters more often. Our promise is to keep __investing in hardening for seasons to come__, all the while working to find __new ways to further improve the game's security__. These will be key factors in reducing the impact of cheaters in both the short and long term. In the meantime, we ask that you continue to report players that you suspect of cheating, as this is a tremendous help for the team.\n\n## REACTIVE PROTECTION\n\n### QB SYSTEM - EXPANSION\n\nThe QB System is our bespoke security system which saw an extremely successfully introduction in late 2022, with several cheat creators halting production for Siege. The addition of the QB System into Siege was monumental, but as cheats received updates, more of them were able to function with success. As is the case with other security and Anti-Cheat systems, the QB System requires constant updating, and our team is committed to this. Our new Anti-Cheat team is currently __working on an expansion of the QB System which we believe could be a game changer for the disruption of cheat makers__. We cannot share technical details at this time, but we are hoping to be able to test a prototype in Y9S4.\n\nThe QB System is crucial in undoing the increase in cheating that players have felt this season, and it remains to be a high priority for the team.\n\n### MOUSETRAP - MOUSE & KEYBOARD DETECTION ON CONSOLE\n\nMouseTrap first released in Y8S1 with unprecedented success, reducing spoofing device usage by 78%. In some cases, cheaters did find ways around this system and so the team has worked to resolve any exploits that have arisen.\n\nToday we are focusing our MouseTrap efforts on its __detection capabilities, continuously making updates__ and monitoring its performance. As we continue to work, we will be ensuring that __more device types can be detected with increased accuracy.__\n\n__MOUSETRAP - PC MATCHMAKING__\n\nAs we have shared previously, an overhaul on the MouseTrap sanctions system will also be coming in Y9S4, forcing confirmed users of spoofing devices into PC matchmaking. Let us be clear too, that those players will be fighting on the proper PC playing field, so we are working to __ensure that PC recoil will also be activated in those cases__. If you are using a spoofing device, you will not have an advantage.\n\n## MATCH CANCELLATION 3.0\n\nMatch Cancellation 3.0 will be coming in __Y9S4__ and will feature Cheater Match Cancellation. With this version, once a cheater is confirmed and consequently banned, the match they are in will be automatically cancelled, leading to less time being spent by honest players in unfair matches.\n\n## BANS - DATA BANS + BATTLEYE\n\n### BAN NUMBERS\n\nBan data for the 2024 so far, including new data for May and June.\n![[R6S] PLAYER PROTECTION UPDATE – AUGUST 2024 - Ban numbers](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7KKL5W450bEPOCfkAIjadE/ed2012c3d9d292e2110f8cfb71399494/R6_BanChart_Jan-Jun24.jpg)\n\n## A MESSAGE FROM THE ANTI-CHEAT TEAM\n\nAs passionate developers and players, we acknowledge __cheating as a top priority for our game__. We believe fairness is at the core of a competitive game such as Siege, and are fully dedicated to making it a safer, fairer, and a more competitive space. We believe that we have gathered the right team of passionate experts to tip the scales in our favor in the cat and mouse game we play against cheaters and cheat-makers. As we move forward, we will be providing more transparency on our ongoing strategies.\n\n# ANTI-TOXICITY\n\n![[R6S] PLAYER PROTECTION UPDATE – AUGUST 2024 - antitoxicity](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5OkxcLRECm0ELbBuiGN6l7/154af1d2a0a8a35acc4059bcb0c5c773/AT.Light.GREEN.150x960.png)\n\n## TOXICITY MONITORING\n\n### PHILOSOPHY - PROTECTING PLAYERS FROM TOXICITY\n\nWe have redefined the way we want to monitor and drive our initiatives related to toxicity in Siege, and our main focus remains to __protect all players from experiencing toxicity in-game while measuring toxicity in a way that makes sense for all players__.\n\n### IN-GAME PLAYER REPORTS\n\nIn-game player reports are crucial for connecting player experiences with the Anti-Toxicity team. While your reports help to manually outline the possible behavioral patterns of an individual, they also help us to analyse the current state of toxicity in-game through your perception of it. This is why in the future, we will be making changes to ensure that the report feature is as accurate as it should be.\n\n## NEW MINDSET\n\n### LEARNINGS\n\nSince the Reputation System first released in its Beta form, we have received a lot of valuable feedback. This feedback has taught us that all features related to Anti-Toxicity must be transparent and clear. We know that we have not met this standard yet.\n\nWith your help, we have learned that we need to more closely align our Anti-Toxicity features with your expectations and sensitivities, fostering a fair and collaborative environment. Our commitment is to ensure that this system not only protects but is also easily understood by everyone. The primary goal of the Reputation System remains to protect the community from recurrent or highly toxic players while rewarding those who consistently demonstrate positive behavior.\n\n### REPUTATION STANDINGS\n\nMoving forward, __we will be removing abusable actions that affect a player's Reputation__ __Standing__. We will also be removing or updating any Anti-Toxicity features that can be exploited. The result will be that only your own actions will have a negative impact on you.\n\n__Changes:__\n\n- __[Y9S1]__ Deactivation of Written Chat and Voice Chat Penalties that could have relied on the unverified actions of other players.\n- __[Y9S2.3]__ Deactivation of the Friendly Fire kick that could be abused leading to targeted players being kicked.\n- __[Y9S4]__ Future removal of abusable or inaccurate actions which feed the Reputation System.\n- __[Future Update]__ Removal of the Reverse Friendly Fire deactivation after reviving a teammate, due to its abuse.\n\n### REPUTATION SYSTEM: Y9S4 REFRESH\n\nThe __current Reputation System is not as transparent or as clear to understand as we would like__, and so in __Y9S4__ __we are aiming to release a refresh__. As part of this, we are designing a new Reputation Center which will be easier to understand for everyone and give better insight into how your actions will affect your Standing.\n\n__MOUSETRAP IMPLEMENTATION__\n\nThis new Reputation System will also tap into MouseTrap in __Y9S4__, meaning the usage of spoofing devices will start to affect players' Reputation.\n\n__AUTOMATED TEXT CHAT MODERATION__\n\nComing to the Reputation System in __Y9S4__ __is AI text chat moderation__. With this, AI will analyze and moderate all text chat messages in real-time, resulting in problematic messages being censored or flagged. Your messages will have an impact on your Reputation Standing, whether they are censored, flagged, or positive.\n\n__IMPACTS & FULL RELEASE__\n\nImpacts based on your Reputation Standing alone will not be activated until the Reputation System leaves Beta and a full release is realised. This will not happen until we are absolutely confident in the robustness of the Reputation System, while being sure that it is understandable, transparent and clear for players. With this in mind, we will not be sharing potential dates for a full release just yet.\n\n### ADDITIONAL UPDATES & FEATURES\n\nHere is a look at some of the other Anti-Toxicity topics that our team is working on at the moment but are not yet ready to be shared in detail.\n\n__COMMENDATIONS & SQUADS__\n\nWe know that the Commendation system is not as rewarding for those that regularly play in squads, and this is due to the Commendation limits that were put in place with the feature launch. We are working to change this behavior to make it more fair for squads.\n\n__IN-GAME REPORTING OVERHAUL__\n\nThe report system can be used in ways which reduce the accuracy of reporting overall. We plan to overhaul this system in the future with this in mind.\n\n__VOICE CHAT MODERATION__\n\nAutomatic voice chat moderation is a very important topic for us, and it will be added to the game as soon as we are ready.\n\n__REPUTATION SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES__\n\nThe Reputation System has a lot of dependencies with other elements of the game. We know that in some instances bugs can cause certain actions to be unfairly received or go unaccounted for. We are working on clear mitigation plans and safeguards to be sure that these situations impact you less.\n\n## TO THE FUTURE\n\nWith a new strategy, our latest learnings, and a wealth of updates and changes planned, we hope that the Reputation System will become a powerful tool for players. __We want everyone to have the power and knowledge needed to be able to control their path, and we are working towards a clearer system__.\n\nThank you for your feedback; we look forward to bringing these changes to you.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","anti-cheat","toxicity","dev-blogs"],"readTime":11,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3ZO4TETkmQyyXSNXcQqi2w/player-protection-update","date":"2024-08-02T15:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"5yr68dk5Ez3UtuzmGFtjwb","title":"Y9S2.3 PATCH NOTES","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S2.3!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7uAbuofI0RTo7vHDWH57Lf/2791911753c3ab57b43238d0565188ef/PN_Y9S2.3_960x540.jpg","content":"Here you can find the updates and fixes for the Y9S2.3 patch.\n\n# Y9S2.3 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n-   Ubisoft Connect: 570 MB\n-   Steam: 486 MB\n-   Xbox One: 0.8 GB\n-   Xbox Series X: 1 GB\n-   PlayStation 4: 525 MB\n-   PlayStation 5: 3.63 GB\n\n# PLAYER PROTECTION\n\n__DEACTIVATION OF THE REPUTATION STANDING POP-UP:__\n\n- Instead of a Reputation Notice pop-up, a yellow dot will now appear on the main menu's Reputation System tile every time a player's current Reputation Standing changes.\n\n__DEACTIVATION OF TEAM KILL KICK:__\n\n- Players will no longer be kicked from a match after excessively killing or damaging too many allies but will still have reverse friendly fire activated. Team kills and ally damage will still count towards penalties and impact current reputation.\n\n# PlayStation® TOURNAMENT\n\n- The Rainbow Six Siege PlayStation® Tournaments feature has been deactivated permanently.\n\n# OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n### AZAMI\n\n- Kiba Barrier: Increased bullet damage received.\n\n### BUCK\n\n- Removed GONNE-6.\n\n### GRIDLOCK\n\n- Increased Trax Stingers' damage to 15hp (from 10).\n\n### ECHO\n\n- Added Magnified Scope to the MP5SD.\n- Changed to 3 health and 1 speed (from 2/2).\n\n### ELA\n\n- Removed Observation Blocker.\n- Added Impact Grenades.\n\n### MELUSI\n\n- Removed Magnified Scope from MP5.\n- Added ITA12S as a secondary weapon.\n- Increased Banshee Sonic Defense to 4 (from 3).\n\n### WAMAI\n\n- Removed Magnified Scope from MP5K.\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED - Objective flow breaks when vaulting outside a window located at 2F East Corridor during the action phase of the Defense Tutorial. \n\n### LEVEL DESIGN  \n\nFIXED - Operator's leg clips through a wall next to the door located at 2F Day Care on the Theme Park map.\n\nFIXED - Players can navigate on top of the concrete cover located at 2F Target Corridor on the Stadium Alpha map.\n\n### OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Fenrir's F-NATT Dread Mine can be clipped inside wooden panels using a bulletproof camera.\n\nFIXED - Players can do melee attacks with Montagne's Le Roc Shield before it's finished deploying.\n\n### USER EXPERIENCE\n\nFIXED - Chat loses functionality for all players if two users send a message with the maximum number of characters.\n\nFIXED - Battle Pass tab replaces the Main Menu tab when leaving the Battle Pass map and pressing the escape key at the same time.\n\nFIXED - Intro tab is incorrectly highlighted when going to the progression menu from a modal that takes you to the Battle Pass tab.        \n\nFIXED - Chat doesn't appear or is slow to load for other players of an online session if Text Chat channel is set to All.\n\nFIXED - Chat window shrinks in size if players send successive long messages.\n\nFIXED - Text chat messages are not sent when pressing Enter during the match.\n\nFIXED - Placeholder text is present for the Squad Leader in the bottom left corner of the screen during the After Action Report.\n\nFIXED - Recoil patterns occasionally won't load in the Advanced Weapon Stats section if players cycle through multiple attachments of the same type in full screen.\n\nFIXED - Fire Power weapon stat doesn't account barrel attachment changes.\n\nFIXED - Placeholder name and organization appear in the loadout menu of the shooting range and attacker repick before the player selects an operator.","categories":["rainbow-six","patch-notes"],"readTime":4,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5yr68dk5Ez3UtuzmGFtjwb/y9s23-patch-notes","date":"2024-07-25T09:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"6dN3Cvhf3lyZO52nAgcRuQ","title":"Y9S2.3 Designer’s Notes","abstract":"In this latest edition of Designer’s Notes, we'll go into more detail about the balancing changes that’ll come with the Y9S2.3 update and give you some insight into the reasons behind them.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2tYz3kUebGWfXaZ6aHUTfu/0242910c23d149c3c0e1fb730172d979/DESIGNER_NOTES_Y9S2_960x540_V2.png","content":"In this latest edition of Designer's Notes, we'll go into detail about the balancing changes that'll come with the Y9S2.3 update and give you some insight into the reasons behind them.\n\n# BALANCING MATRIX AND TOP OPERATOR BANS\n\n### WIN DELTA VS.

Following the update in Y9S1, the rates shifted to 42% explosives, 29% melee, and 28% bullets. However, during the season, explosive usage increased while bullet damage decreased. As a result, we made adjustments in the mid-season patch, but the usage of bullets didn't even match the numbers we had at the beginning of the season.\n\nTo address this, we've decided to further boost the damage modifiers. After analyzing a longer data period, we're less concerned about barriers being too vulnerable to bullets at close range. Melee attackers continue to be a more efficient and quicker method for barrier destruction. Our goal is to make barrier destruction more viable from longer distances, taking into account the damage drop-off of weapons. We aim for a more balanced usage of bullets and explosives.\n\n#### KIBA BARRIER\n\n- Increased damage received by Handguns:\n  - 20% by Small calibers (e.g. USP40).\n  - 30% by Medium calibers (e.g. M45 MEUSOC).\n  - 20% by High calibers (e.g. D-50).\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Revolvers.\n- Increased by 30% the damage received by Machine Pistols.\n- Increased damage increased by Submachine Guns:\n  - 30% by Small calibers (e.g. Mx4 Storm).\n  - 20% by Medium calibers (e.g. K1A).\n  - 20% by High calibers (e.g. UZK50GI).\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Assault Rifles.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Light Machine Guns.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Designated Marksman Rifles.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Sniper Rifles.\n  - 150% by CSRX 300.\n\n### BUCK\n\nOver the past couple of years, attackers have gained additional tools to counter defenders' bulletproof utility (such as Brava and Ram) and increased access to explosives (including the additional Gonne-6 and Frag Grenades). As time has passed, many of the stronger defenders have already been addressed by adding more non-explosive counters (like Azami and Fenrir). Therefore, we believe that Buck's Gonne-6 is overshadowing other operators who specialize in explosive capabilities.\n\nOur intention for Buck is to maintain his focus on environmental destruction and vertical play. We feel that the Gonne-6 is unnecessary for him to excel in this area.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n\n### ECHO\n\nDespite the increased pick rate of the Supernova (approximately from 5% to 20%), our intention to position it as an alternative to the usual site architects has unfortunately resulted in it being underutilized. Consequently, we have decided to restore its armor and speed ratings and reintroduce the Magnified Scopes into the MP5SD. The new sights are designed to encourage a more passive playstyle, which should synergy well with him staying on drones at a distance from the action and hold long angles if needed.\n\nWe acknowledge that these adjustments alone may not be sufficient to increase Echo's presence substantially, so we are investigating additional changes for the Yokai drones in the background.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n- Armor: 3 (from 2).\n- Speed: 1 (from 2).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5SD: Added Magnified Scopes to sights options.\n\n### ELA\n\nAs we are adjusting the killing potential of Melusi and Wamai, we have identified an opportunity to enhance her roaming capabilities to fill the gap that those operators might be leaving. Given the recent additions to the defensive roaster, Ela's role has become more constrained. To address this, we have decided to reintroduce her Impact Grenades, allowing her greater mobility and additional tools against Ballistic Shields.\n\nEla's current lethality is significantly lower than it was in Year 3 when we initially removed the grenades. By reintroducing them, our goal is to make her gameplay more dynamic during the round without creating an overly oppressive experience for the attacking team.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary gadgets: Removed Observation Blocker. Added Impact Grenades.\n\n### GRIDLOCK\n\nDespite she has a lot of resources and each canister covering a relatively large area, defenders do not seem particularly scared when encountering them. And the punishment for ignoring them is not severe enough. Currently, an enemy only takes 3 ticks of damage when crossing a fully expanded canister, which is only 30 hit points. Furthermore, even if the covered area is extensive, it is unnecessary to destroy all deployed Trax devices to create a safer path, so only a few bullets are needed to invalidate them.\n\nTo address this, we plan to increase the damage dealt per second. This adjustment will make them more intimidating, prompting defenders to ensure that the path is clear before proceeding. With the new damage output, crossing the area will cost 45 hp, which should encourage defenders to play more cautiously and give attackers more time to react. We remain open to further adjustments if this value does not meet our expectation in practice.\n\n#### TRAX STINGERS\n\n- Damage: Increased to 15hp per second in movement (from 10).\n\n### MELUSI\n\nThe Magnified Scope has notably enhanced her efficiency in combat scenarios, even outperforming other operators with the MP5. Despite her being a 3-armor like Doc and Rook, we consider that she should be more focused on utility usage. Additionally, the introduction of other operators who can fulfill a similar role in a more flexible manner, such as Fenrir, has diminished her utility.\n\nThe proposed adjustments are designed to reduce her killing potential while expanding her contribution to team strategy. The additional resources will help her cover more space or double down in locations that might need more attention. Furthermore, the introduction of a secondary shotgun is intended to foster creativity and versatility preparing the defensive setup.\n\n#### BANSHEE SONIC DEFENSE\n\n- Max. resources: Increase to 4 (from 3).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5: Removed Magnified Scopes from sights options.\n- Secondary weapons: Added ITA12S.\n\n### WAMAI\n\nWhile the MP5K statistics do not currently raise immediate concerns, on the contrary, its efficiency went almost back to pre-Acog levels by the end of Season 1. The rising presence presents a pattern that can remind of past experiences with other operators, such as Alibi, Oryx, and Warden. While these operators weren't overwhelmingly overpowered in terms of stats, their significant presence - specifically the motivation to pick them - was perceived negatively, leading to concerns about game balance. In light of these considerations, we have decided to remove the Magnified Scope.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5K: Removed Magnified Scopes from sights options.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":7,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6dN3Cvhf3lyZO52nAgcRuQ/y9s23-designers-notes","date":"2024-07-24T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"2EijZUDfWQQhiy68cGhhBD","title":"Y9S2.2 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S2.2!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/27hhh43r3tvngQsKQjdaEL/5318fce56af3c92b1e0528225ecb3cde/NEWS_PATCHNOTES_Y9S2_960x540.jpg","content":"Here you can find the updates and fixes for the Y9S2.2 patch.\n\n# Y9S2.2 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 1.26 GB\n- Steam: 857 MB\n- Xbox One: 1 GB\n- Xbox Series X: 1.4 GB\n- PlayStation 4: 1.46 GB\n- PlayStation 5: 1.28 GB\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n## GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED - Deadzone sensitivity doesn't apply calibration properly.\n\nFIXED - Operators can melee through Shields.\n\n## LEVEL DESIGN  \n\nFIXED - Drones can clip inside the wall located in EXT Valley on the Border map.\n\n## OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Ying's Candela ability has a low level of detail when held close to the operator.\n\n## USER EXPERIENCE\n\nFIXED - Drone's red scan ping doesn't display on Player's UI during preparation phase.\n\nFIXED - Dynamic play button text for Matchmaking is duplicated in the upper-left corner.\n\nFIXED - Some reticules for OTs-03 aren't affected by optic color and opacity changes.\n\nFIXED - Players can accept invites to ongoing custom online sessions.\n\nFIXED - \"Unlock with operator Specialties\" option is available after unlocking a pathfinder Operator with renown.\n\nFIXED - Hiding completed challenges can't be toggled by selecting the box under the Challenges tab.\n\nFIXED - Players can't scroll through the Battle Pass after accessing the Challenges tab.\n\n## AUDIO\n\nFIXED - Missing SFX when drones are destroyed while in support mode during the end of the round.\n\n## KNOWN ISSUE [PC]\nDue to a security update some third-party applications that interact with Siege may cause a crash on start-up.\n\nWe recommend temporarily disabling such applications until updated versions are released.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2EijZUDfWQQhiy68cGhhBD/y9s22-patch-notes","date":"2024-07-09T09:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"6WJt2qa45vHi0ST01V6vgJ","title":"Y9S2.1 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S2.1!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7rMXvWW5nDUvZ7x3tZPkO/a7f3fed908df1b8b9abeaacee65096d3/PATCHNOTES_Y9S2_960x540.jpg","content":"# Y9S2.1 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n-   Ubisoft Connect: 1.05 GB\n-   Steam: 1.6 GB\n-   Xbox One: 0.8 GB\n-   Xbox Series X: 1 GB\n-   PlayStation 4: 1.29GB\n-   PlayStation 5: 887 MB\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED - Aiming down sight is cancelled when opening the scoreboard.\n\nFIXED - Reflex C reticle isn't centered on the Bearing 9.\n\nFIXED - Player's movement speed remains reduced if they reload while aiming down sight.\n\nFIXED - Players can eliminate more targets than what's needed in Target Drill on the Kafe Dostoyevsky map.\n\nFIXED - Claymores reappear after being destroyed by Electrified Barbed Wire.\n\n### LEVEL DESIGN\n\nFIXED - Drones can be hidden in the floor located at 2F Elevator Shaft on the Bank map.\n\nFIXED - Players are able to navigate on top of invisible collision located at EXT Docks Bridge on the Kanal map. \n\nFIXED - Flickering textures are present near ledges and on certain objects after destroying barricades when launching the Vulkan executable.\n\nFIXED - Grey carpets are difficult to destroy in 3F Cigar Balcony and 3F Cigar Lounge on the Kafe Dostoyevsky map.\n\nFIXED - Grey Carpets are difficult to destroy in 2F Pink Room on the House map.\n\n### OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Players can use Ram's BU-GI Auto Breacher to reach unintended areas.\n\nFIXED - Smoke Screen becomes bulletproof when using Sens' R.O.U.

While we have always wanted them to be playable and enjoyable in serious matches without being a meme, their potential had to be carefully managed due to the ability to have multiple Recruits on the same team. Additionally, the Recruit served as a safeguard for various systems, which meant that remastering it required also updating those systems.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that players have meaningful choices, the same as we did with the new Weapon Attachments; we want to make every gameplay option viable and interesting. Therefore, we have decided to make the remastered Recruits available in all playlists. However, only one can be selected per team, similar to any other Operator. We've updated their 3D models to help differentiate them during matches, and their loadouts are now fully customizable. As they remain excellent options for learning Siege's mechanics, they will be automatically unlocked for free at level 0.\n\nWe appreciate their versatility in team compositions, so we wanted to enhance this concept. Instead of splitting Secondary Gadgets between Ability and Gadget slots, they will now have access to every secondary utility from their faction in both slots. This flexibility allows for more strategic loadouts. However, using the same gadget in both slots is not allowed. For example, if you select Breach Charges in the Ability slot, you cannot select it again in the Gadget Slot.\n\nThis new approach also means that whenever we introduce a new Secondary Gadget, one of them will receive a buff and expand its tactical possibilities. Our guiding principle is that no Secondary Gadget should surpass an Operator's unique Ability, so more specialized Operators will always remain the most efficient choice.\n\nStriker, in particular, stands out as a versatile support on attack. You can assist Thermite with Impact EMP Grenades for breaching walls while using Hard Breach Charges to open the remaining hatches. Alternatively, protect your teammates by placing Claymores to block flanks and Smoke Grenades to control lines of sight. Or even take on the entry role with Frag Grenades and Stun Grenades while your team does the hard work.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n- Armor: 2\n\n- Speed: 2\n\n#### GADGET KIT (ABILITY)\n\n- Equips two gadgets instead of a gadget and an ability. Can select any attacking gadget on the team, but not the same twice.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Primary weapons: M4, M249\n\n- Secondary weapons: 5.7 USG, ITA12S\n\n### SENTRY\n\nSentry serves as the defensive counterpart to Striker. Their primary objective is to assist with site setup and provide any missing utility. If you require additional intel, consider bringing a Bulletproof Camera and Proximity Alarms. For enhanced map control, opting for a Deployable Shield and Barbed Wire would be more ideal.\n\nBASE STAT\n\n-   Armor: 2\n-   Speed: 2\n\nGADGET KIT (ABILITY)\n\n-   Equips two gadgets instead of a gadget and an ability. Can select any defensive gadget on the team, but not the same twice.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Primary weapons: Commando 9, M870\n-   Secondary weapons: C75 Auto, Super Shorty\n\n### FENRIR\n\nOur main goal is to provide Attackers with additional methods and opportunities to effectively handle the deployed mines while enhancing a more strategic environment without negating Fenrir's anti-rush capabilities.\n\nThe intention is to create an environment where Attackers feel less overwhelmed by Fenrir's presence. To achieve this, we have expanded the ways to counter the mines. Proper droning will be rewarded, allowing players to clear the mines progressively, whether they are active or not.\n\nFenrir's effectiveness will now be closely tied to the deployment type and gadget size, rather than relying mainly on bulletproof capacities. Similar to other devices, ensuring that the mines are discreet and strategically placed increases their effectiveness and survivability through the round. Additionally, the Observation Blocker will help Fenrir keep their location more challenging to discover. This will also reduce Fenrir's crowd control capabilities at the same time as it will replace the Barbed Wire.\n\nFenrir's utility now hinges on his survival. We encourage calculated risks and active engagement with the gadget. The new ticket system and adjusted number of resources require constant attention. Fenrir won't be capable of covering all the flanks and will need to react to the attackers' push to be efficient and capitalize on his utility. This updated behavior will also reduce the entry barrier for new players because you are not double-punished by a wrong or experimental placement.\n\n#### F-NATT DREAD MINE\n\n-   Max. resources (Mines): Reduced to 4 (from 5).\n-   Max. resources (Tickets): Reduced to 2 (from 3).\n-   An inactive mine is no longer bulletproof.\n-   Tickets are no longer lost when an active mine is destroyed. They will return to Fenrir's inventory.\n-   Disabling a mine automatically gets its ticket removed. They will return to Fenrir's inventory.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary gadgets: Added Observation Blocker. Removed Barbed Wire.\n\n### SOLIS\n\nWe have two primary objectives; First we would like to reduce Solis pressure over the attacking drones, specifically during the Preparation Phase. Second we would like to increase the amount of players' attention on SPEC-IO resource management.\n\nSolis has proven highly effective in hunting and neutralizing drones, which are crucial to build a successful Attack strategy. If Attackers cannot reveal the defenders' set up and position their drones inside the building the attack is likely to fail. Our goal is to strike a balance: Solis should remain relevant in this role while Attackers gain additional opportunities to fulfill their droning operations. With this changes Attackers will have less pressure to drone during the prep phase, but they will need to remain careful and aware of Solis during the Action Phase.\n\nAfter some data analysis and observing player behavior we've come to the conclusion that the SPEC-IO resources are too generous. Players usually do not consume all the energy available for the SPEC-IO, and when they do it the wait time until they are back online is quite short. The new SPEC-IO resources setting should encourage players to use the SPEC-IO in shorter bursts rather than keeping them on for long periods of time.\n\nWe also want to reduce a bit Solis' roaming capabilities, specifically her speed while moving through the map. We will replace her Impact Grenades with Proximity Alarms which will give her a new tool to gather intel from long distances. We encourage players to explore less commonly used weapon like the Shotgun ITA12L, adding it to their loadouts will grant Solis is still capable of causing destruction and executing vertical plays.\n\nWe've introduced a set of changes to create a more balanced Solis. However, this isn't her final form! We're closely monitoring the impact of these adjustments while simultaneously developing a fresh wave of changes that will specifically enhance her gadget detection and scanning mechanics. Stay tuned for further improvements.\n\n#### SPEC-IO ELECTRO-SENSOR\n\n- SPEC-IO goggles remain disabled during prep-phase.\n- SPEC-IO energy duration reduced to 10s (from 20s).\n- SPEC-IO needs to fully recharge before using it.\n- SPEC-IO Detection range 12m (from 15m).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary gadgets: Added Proximity Alarm. Removed Impact Grenades.\n\n### DEIMOS\n\nSince his release, Deimos has had relatively low pick and win rates. While we believe the primary reason for this is his more advanced playstyle, we would like to explore ways to make him a little more comfortable to play.\n\nBy adding grip options to Deimos' AK-74M, we're hoping to make the weapon slightly more viable for his more aggressive support playstyle. However, we will be monitoring this change carefully, as we want to make sure that focus remains on taking full advantage of his DeathMARKs and Vendetta.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   AK-74: Added Vertical, Angled, and Horizontal grips.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## BARBED WIRE\n\nOur primary goal is to enhance the effectiveness of Barbed Wire while increasing the risk of not dealing with it on time.\n\nWe aim to make it more reliable for Defenders. It should no longer be an easily bypassed obstacle for Attackers. Instead of routinely passing through the Barbed Wire, we want it to serve as a last-resort option. Attackers should carefully consider their approach before attempting to cross. The Barbed Wire now inflicts 5hp damage per second to any Attacker moving through it. While this isn't a substantial amount, it should encourage Attackers to respect its presence. Importantly, the damage only occurs while the operator is actively moving within the wire. This means that they can still enter and hold an angle without taking damage.\n\nDefenders should now rely on their hearing to detect Attackers moving through the wire. The operator's vocal reaction upon receiving damage reinforces the urgency of the situation and makes it more reliable.

We're currently restructuring, growing, and allocating more resources to our Anti-Cheat team, ensuring that we can provide a secure future for Siege. As the team expands, we'll have more opportunities to reflect the benefits of this growing team in-game. While we're in this stage, our team remains focused on improving your experience.\n\n## BANS: DATA BANS + BATTLEYE\n\n### BAN NUMBERS\n\nHere we have our latest ban data, including bans for February, March, and April.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – MAY 2024 - BanChart](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1VO5c6wIwyxqgkEubx0ooN/965e2ac5c7521678f509e9f7c877b169/R6_BanChart_Nov-Apr24.jpg)\n\n### DATA BANS & ADDITIONAL DETECTIONS\n\nThis season marks a significant evolution in our approach to cheating, as we've made improvements to our Data Ban system moving to a machine learning model. We've vastly increased the number of data points used to analyze a player's performance, resulting in a __meaningful increase in cheaters being detected and sanctioned through this method__. We've also optimized our sanctioning process by increasing how often we run our sanctions, effectively __reducing the time it takes to ban detected cheaters by half using this model__.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, we also have new Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detections which are currently being used to sanction players. We know that this has been affecting players and we want to make it clear that we are working on identifying behaviors and sanctioning players who are taking advantage of these services.\n\nLooking ahead, we're working on an improved detection of AFK avoiders (idle botters) as well as additional cheat detection updates. These will further enhance our ability to identify and ban cheaters in Rainbow Six Siege, improving the experience for everyone.\n\n## ADDRESSED CHEATS & HARDENING\n\n### ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS\n\n__CHEATING INCREASE__\n\nAs we recently [communicated](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1785686962097005015), we are aware of the increase in cheating behaviors reported by the community. We want to reassure you that addressing these concerns is a top priority for our Anti-Cheat team and that we are looking to deploy solutions to resolve these issues as soon as possible. The Y9S1.3 patch deployed on May 2<sup>nd</sup> has temporarily improved this situation while we work on longer term solutions to prevent those cheats.\n\n__CRASH EXPLOIT__\n\nOur team is actively working on a fix for the Crash Exploit reported by the community. Until then, Abandon Penalties have been retroactively reduced to a 5-minute duration.  All newly issued Abandon Penalties will be 5 minutes as well. Thanks a lot for your reports!\n\n### ADDRESSED CHEATS\n\nSeveral cheats have been addressed since our last Anti-Cheat Status Update, with some updates going live with Y9S1.3. However, in recent months, we have seen a dramatic decrease in a number of rage cheats being used. This reflects the ongoing work that our team is doing in order to tackle new cheats and protect the game and its players.\n\n### HARDENING\n\nHardening is the act of increasing the security and reducing the surface of vulnerability of the game's code, to protect against attackers. In Y9S1.2, we made several changes which resulted in improved overall game security, and we'll have more improvements coming in Y9S2. These improvements are continuous, and our updates are playing a crucial role in making the game safer. We'll be sharing more on our hardening efforts in the future.\n\n## QB SYSTEM\n\nQB is a security system available on PC, designed to make cheat creation more tedious, difficult, and expensive. By creating a less effective environment for cheat creators, our aim is to reduce the amount of cheats being successfully created and sold.\n\n### UPDATE CADENCE & UX IMPROVEMENTS\n\nWe want to ensure that QB remains effective, so as promised, we are continuing to provide regular updates to this system, and these will come at an increased cadence compared to Year 8.\n\nAnother goal of ours is to share more information with legitimate players, helping to understand why a game restart may be happening. Some of these changes are already live; for instance, you may now see the \"Update available\" prompt in-game in some circumstances, asking you to restart the game when possible.\n\n## MOUSETRAP\n\n### CURRENT STATUS\n\nMouseTrap is a system designed to detect spoofing devices which enable the use of mouse and keyboard on consoles. Changes implemented in Y9S1 have broadened its detection capabilities, allowing us to find more suspicious players.\n\nThis season, we are also focusing on your feedback, with most changes being aimed towards enhancing our current system. The Y9S1.3 update is helping to further increase the accuracy of MouseTrap by expanding on the types of devices that it can recognize, and improving the detection of currently identifiable devices. As well as this, the update is working to further minimize false positives, resulting in fewer controller players being incorrectly detected.\n\n### MOUSETRAP PENALTIES & MATCHMAKING [TARGET: Y9S4]\n\nIn Y9S4, we'll be making use of MouseTrap's detection in new ways, directly improving the experience for controller players. In this upcoming Y9S4 update, if a player is detected using a spoofing device three times,the updated Crossplay system will __automatically place them into the PC matchmaking pool__ for a 90-day period. This will result in matches that feel fairer for controller players, while giving users of the spoofing devices a choice in how they want to play the game.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, our dedication to upholding the integrity and fairness of Rainbow Six Siege is unwavering. Our goal this year is to make Rainbow Six Siege both more secure and more reactive when it comes to cheating. Through a multifaceted approach, encompassing machine learning and Data Bans, rigorous hardening, and innovative detection systems such as QB and Mousetrap, we are continuously following up on our commitment to safeguarding the gaming experience for all players.\n\nCheaters have no place in Siege, our teams are committed to making Siege safe and enjoyable for everyone.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","anti-cheat","dev-blogs"],"readTime":6,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2V90gThNqHBtmzK4Bf6AhV/anticheat-status-update-may-2024","date":"2024-05-10T15:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"4Xwna9dWPwd3m4KUcGrHIp","title":"Y9S1 Mid-Season Roadmap Update","abstract":"See the upcoming features detailed in this mid-season roadmap update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4w3HMFvz9ZPOXFZs41XU7s/38693eb4c14d1e212d53f987b25c0915/Y9S1_Roadmap.jpg","content":"Each season, we provide a Roadmap update to offer further insights into the development of upcoming features to ensure transparent communication with all players.

However, despite this shift, their performance statistics do not raise any immediate concerns. Consequently, we have decided not to make any adjustments to the sights distribution in this patch.*\n\n*It's essential to recognize that the graphs presented reflect only a small segment of the Ranked player base. Below those ranks and across the broader player community, the presence of these operators is considerably lower.*\n\n*Their presence was higher at the beginning of the season and gradually declined to the numbers you see right now. This downward trend suggests that these operator choices are driven more by novelty than by overwhelming strength. We observed similar patterns during the 1,5x era, and based on tests conducted over the past year, we prefer a cautious approach rather than immediate reaction because the system is still too new. We believe maintaining the current distribution throughout the entire season won't compromise the overall balance.*\n\n*Additionally, prematurely removing these operators could prompt players to swiftly switch to the next operator equipped with Magnified Scope. Such a shift might adversely impact the balance of other operators that have not received as much attention and are currently in a good position. Hasty removal would not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate all the pros and cons of the new sights, especially considering that nostalgia and novelty are still influencing the decisions.*\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### AZAMI\n\n#### KIBA BARRIER\n\n- Increased by 10% the damage received by High caliber Handguns and Revolvers.\n  - Handguns: .44 Mag Semi-Auto, D-50\n  - Revolvers: .44 Vendetta, Keratos .357, LFP586\n- Increased by 10% the damage received by Medium caliber Submachine Guns and Assault Rifles.\n  - Submachine Guns: K1A, P90, UMP45, Vector.45 ACP\n  - Assault Rifles: 416-C Carbine, 552 Commando, 556XI, AK-12, AR33, AUG A2, C7E, C8-SFW, Commando 9, F2, F90, G36C, L85A2, PARA-308, POF-9, R4-C, SC3000K, Type-89\n- Increased by 5% the damage received by High caliber Assault Rifles and Light Machine Guns.\n  - Assault Rifles: AK-74M, ARX200, M4, M762, Mk17 CQB, Spear .308, V308\n  - Light Machine Guns: 6P41, ALDA 5.56, DP27, G8A1, LMG-E, M249, M249 SAW, T-95 LSW\n\nThe weapon base damage, the damage drop-off curve, the distance to the barrier, and the barrier resistance are just a few of the variables we need to consider for the +100 weapons available when balancing this system. We were already aware that the Kiba Barriers might still require too many bullets to be destroyed by certain weapons. However, we wanted to be cautious not to render the barriers completely ineffective now that every operator will be able to deal with them. As a result, we opted for an initial release with barriers that remain robust. Our plan is to iterate, seeking the optimal balance while closely monitoring the impact of each adjustment.\n\nDespite the data is showing that the new feature is being utilized, the lifespan of the barriers hasn't significantly changed. This suggests that Attackers continue to face challenges when dealing with them. Explosives and melee attacks remain the primary methods of destruction, making the risk associated with shooting at a barrier still high enough to favor the use of explosives.\n\nUpon analyzing the damage received by the barriers during destruction, we observed that Designated Marksman Rifles perform exceptionally well against them. Consequently, our focus will primarily be on increasing the damage received from Assault Rifles and Light Machine Guns. The additional weapons mentioned here are affected for the sake of consistency, as they share the same caliber configuration.\n\n### IANA\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary Gadgets: Added Impact EMP Grenade. Removed Stun Grenades.\n\nConsidering her ability to bait defenders and facilitate re-frag opportunities for teammates following the hologram, she should be an excellent operator choice for support players. Additionally, her infinite intel gathering resources make her particularly advantageous in the current situation, where drones are limited. Therefore, we will enhance her support capabilities by incorporating Impact EMP Grenades and maybe look into the Gemini Replicator in the future.\n\n### LESION\n\n#### GU MINE\n\n-   Initial damage: Reduced to 3hp (from 5).\n-   Gadget refill timer: Increased to 25 seconds (from 20).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary Gadgets: Added Observation Blocker. Removed Impact Grenades.\n\nSince the removal of cloaking from his GU Mines, we've observed positive changes in his performance. Despite the uncloaked mines, the number of mines triggered per round has remained relatively stable, resulting in higher average damage than initially anticipated.\n\nTo maintain the core essence of the GU Mine, we have made a slight reduction in its initial damage. Our intention is to emphasize the urgency of removing the mine and the fear associated with encountering another one. Rather than an immediate kill, we aim to create a strategic window of opportunity for players to engage with the enemy.\n\nLesion's increased resources allow him to exert significant map control very quickly and block attackers' access to the building from very early in the round. Consequently, we've extended the time required to acquire the mines. While this may reduce early-round map control, it ensures Lesion's continued impact in late-game scenarios. He remains a priority target for attackers.\n\nRegarding secondary gadgets, we believe that the GU Mines should be enough for slowing down Ballistic Shields and the Impact Grenades give him too much flexibility. So we are going to change them for the Observation Blocker, which also synergies well with its primary ability providing extra protection.\n\n### NOKK\n\n#### HEL PRESENCE REDUCTION\n\n-   Duration: Increased to 30 seconds (from 20).\n-   Cooldown: Increased to 30 seconds (from 20).\n\nThe recent changes to Frag Grenades, along with increased operator access, have had a negative impact on Nokk's presence.\n\nTo mitigate this issue while we investigate other solutions to make her more impactful, we will be increasing the duration of the HEL Presence Reduction. This adjustment will allow Nokk to traverse bigger areas more comfortably without being detected in defenders' cameras and catch them by surprise.\n\n### ORYX\n\n#### REMAH DASH\n\n-   Will destroy Deployable and Talon shields. The dash is not interrupted.\n\nWe are updating the Remah Dash to improve comfort and consistency. From now on, Deployable Shields and Talon Shields will no longer impede Oryx during the dash; instead, they will be destroyed and he will go through. This adjustment aligns with player expectations, especially considering Oryx's existing ability to pass through Kiba Barriers and Reinforced Barricades.\n\n### SENS\n\n#### R.O.U. PROJECTOR SYSTEM\n\n-   Max. Resources: Increase to 4 R.O.U. Projectors (from 3).\n\nDespite the numerous improvements to the POF-9 and the additional utility that brings, Sens continues to underperform. We acknowledge the intricacy and skill required to use the R.O.U. Projectors effectively. The unpredictability of bounces can sometime work against you. We hope the new Trajectory Previsualization can help to improve accuracy, but we are going to allocate additional resources to enhance flexibility and provide more opportunities for error correction while we keep investigating new ways to improve it.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## IMPACT GRENADE\n\n### EXPLOSION\n\n- Damage: Reduced to 40hp (from 60).\n- Radius: Reduced to 2 meters (from 3).\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Azami\n- Caveira\n- Clash\n- Echo\n- Goyo\n- Maestro\n- Melusi\n- Rook\n- Valkyrie\n- Vigil\n- Wamai\n\nWe recognize the growing significance of Impact Grenades over the years. They play a crucial role in site setup, facilitate defenders' swift rotations, aid in clearing attackers utility, deny walls, and even eliminate adversaries. However, we acknowledge their excessive versatility, which prompts us to address their killing potential and wall-denial capabilities.\n\nWe have implemented a reduction in damage. As a result, double-impacting an enemy will no longer result in an immediate kill. Also, opponents must be even more damaged to employ a grenade to secure the elimination.\n\nThe reduction in explosion radius will yield two key effects:\n\n1.  Impact-Tricking countermeasures: Attackers can prevent it by positioning the hard-breach device as close to the ground as possible in additional locations, And defender must be more accurate to do it successfully.\n2.  Precision requirement for utility clearance: Defenders must exercise greater accuracy when dealing with attackers' utility, such as Airjabs and Claymores. This adjustment allows attackers to place more reliance on this type of gadgets and experiment with unexpected placements.\n\nOur intention is to promote the use of the right tool in the right situation, rather than relying solely on something that can serve multiple purposes. Defenders have other tools at their disposal that can achieve these objectives more effectively. Our final goal is to enhance tactical gameplay and reward the correct decision-making in every match.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\n### GUARD BREAK\n\n-   Explosion: Trigger threshold reduced to 30 damage (from 50).\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blitz\n- Fuze\n- Montagne\n- Clash\n\nOur goal is to ensure that the Impact Grenades remain effective counters against Ballistic Shields. Because of the recent damage change, we find it necessary to adjust the threshold for breaking a shield owner's guard. \n\nThe guard break system relies on the damage received, and it's important to note that no other explosives have undergone alterations. Consequently, other explosive devices will now create larger openings than before.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2D4HsYOBEEg0wEW5dim34o/y9s13-designers-notes","date":"2024-04-30T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"3snO7ANe2VLZYitMeP2eqc","title":"Reputation System Beta: Status Update","abstract":"Reputation System Developments in Year 9.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6Sov86Js8p3e8gLeuVSXWQ/497134ec303da98abb9d350c59a26fab/RepSys.Y9S1.960x540.png","content":"In Y9S1 and beyond, we'll continue to update the Reputation System Beta to ensure its accuracy before any Standing Impacts go live.\n\nThis season, we've made several changes to the Reputation System. In this article, we'll share more on what these changes mean and how we plan to continue improving this system.\n\n## Y9S1 - POST LAUNCH LEARNING\n\nFollowing the Y9S1 release, it became clear that certain aspects of the Reputation System were not working as intended. Our teams gathered and analyzed player feedback while completing internal investigations, leading us to identify issues affecting the player experience.\n\n### COMMUNICATION PENALTIES - VOICE & WRITTEN\n\nWe found that players were receiving communication penalties at a higher rate than expected. In response to this, a decision was made to disable the voice chat and written chat penalties. These communication penalties will remain disabled until we can implement further levers to ensure that all penalties given are fair, while also providing players a clear path to improvement.\n\nOn consoles, we were made aware of another issue which led to increased voice chat reports being visible in the Reputation Center. We also found that in some cases, misconduct such as Griefing or Voice Abuse was incorrectly labeled as \"Excessive\" in the Reputation Centre. A fix was released addressing these on March 21<sup>st</sup>.\n\n### COMMENDATION EFFECTS\n\nAfter season launch, we became aware of an issue affecting the speed at which Commendations would be reflected in a player's Standing, resulting in lower Standings for many players. Commendations are now affecting Standings promptly and correctly.\n\n## Y9S1 - REPUTATION SYSTEM UPDATE\n\n### STANDING DEFINITIONS & BALANCING UPDATE\n\nWith the launch of Y9S1, we implemented our latest balancing update for the Reputation System. Here we used the built-in weights and levers to better define the attainment of each Standing, aligning more closely with our intentions. The five bracket Standings were also redefined to provide more meaning to each of them.\n\nThe aim behind system balancing is to ensure that your Standing mirrors your actions. Right now, many players will find themselves in the Respectable bracket. Being in Respectable is a great place to be and should be the aim; it means you're the core of the Siege community, you're not detracting from others' experiences, and you're playing with care, making Siege enjoyable for players around you. Some players with consistent positive behavior might also enter the Esteemed and Exemplary brackets, but maintaining these can be more challenging.\n\nLooking at the two lower brackets, falling into Disruptive doesn't necessarily mean your behavior is always negative, but it does indicate that you're not playing to the Siege ideals overall. With some effort, the Respectable Standing can be achieved. However, if a player finds themselves in Dishonorable, it means there are clear negative trends. In these cases, players need to adjust their behavior and remain consistent to improve their Standing and experience for the community's benefit.\n\n## WHAT'S NEXT?\n\n### MORE LEVERS, MORE CONFIDENCE\n\nWe've learned a lot since the Reputation System entered, in Y8S4, in its grace period and we're continuing to integrate those learnings to ensure that the Reputation System is fair, resilient, and understandable for all players.\n\nWe are currently making progress in incorporating protections that make a player's Standing more robust, going beyond reacting to player reports, and instead using additional factors. These improvements are directly driven by the feedback you have shared with us.\n\nOur work continues so that we can develop further levers that will enable us to reactivate the communication penalties. We want to ensure that our system applies penalties only where necessary, and that players have a full understanding and trust in the Reputation System.\n\n### STANDING IMPACTS & RELEASE STATUS\n\nThanks to your feedback, it's became clear that large changes are needed in order for the Reputation System to meet the requirements that we've set. With this in mind, Impacts based on your Standing will be no longer be introduced in Y9S2 and will instead come in a later season. Consequently, as the Reputation System will not see its full release in the coming season, it will remain in Beta for now.\n\nWe'll be sharing more information soon on when you can expect to see Impacts and the full release of the Reputation System. The deployment of Impacts will also be announced ahead of time so that players can be prepared. Once this feature does go live, we'll be monitoring the system closely and listening to your feedback on the update.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Reputation System will continue to retain its Beta status, reflecting its current form as we continue to make improvements and collect further feedback. Our priority will be to ensure that everyone is confident in the state of the Reputation System as we focus on reducing toxicity and making Siege a fun and enjoyable game for everyone.\n\nWe aim to continue to provide transparency and responsiveness around this system, and as we move forward, we want to keep hearing about your experiences. We're always listening as we work to provide a safe community.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","toxicity","dev-blogs"],"readTime":5,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3snO7ANe2VLZYitMeP2eqc/reputation-system-beta-status-update","date":"2024-04-19T15:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"6r7w3uI79e9NepbNoimFra","title":"Y9S1.2 PATCH NOTES","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S1.2!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7wjVhdq5CnLkSXGKrE85IK/eb1e2f857d63f096ed0389d585539fd6/Y9S1.2_PatchNotes.960x540.jpg","content":"See the fixes here coming in Y9S1.2.\n\n## Y9S1.2 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n-   Ubisoft Connect: 918.5 MB\n-   Steam: 479 MB\n-   Xbox One: 0.77 GB\n-   Xbox Series X: 2.1 GB\n-   PlayStation 4: 1.44 GB\n-   PlayStation 5: 929 MB\n\n## BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED -

Her ability to reshape the map is something that has changed Siege forever. But in a lot of situations, her ability requires too much from attackers or creates unfair situations.\n\nThey can be placed in locations that are impossible to reach with melees or extremely risky to approach. Additionally, explosives as the only reliable way to counter them makes her very taxing for Attackers and limits their flexibility to pick operators with non-explosive utility. Repeatedly destroying placed barriers is tedious and frustrating for attackers, even more so if you have used explosives to deal with them.\n\nTo try and solve those problems, we tested several options that were later discarded:\n\n-   __Soft__: The idea was to allow bullets to go through the barrier. This turned the barriers into an indestructible soft wall, which was interesting, and fixed some nasty pixel peeks that are unchallengeable for attackers. It also mitigated the urgency to destroy them, therefore the resources required, as you could pre-fire through them to inhibit the defender from using them. But we considered that this took away too much of the Kiba Barrier's identity.\n\n-   __Lifespan__: In this prototype, the barriers would only last for a specific time and then they would auto-destroy. The main problem with this version was that Attackers didn't have any authority or a new way to deal with them besides waiting, and it wasn't a fun interaction.\n\nFinally, we decided that adding a new way to destroy them from a distance was the best approach, so the barriers keep their essence and Attackers have more options. Kiba Barriers will now be __vulnerable to bullets.__ They will take damage and get destroyed when their life is down to 0. As they are similar to walls, the damage received will be affected by the weapon caliber, so high caliber weapons, such as DMRs or LMGs, will destroy the barriers faster, while lower caliber weapons, such as Handguns or SMGs, will require more bullets. \n\nAll the other ways to destroy the barriers will remain the same, so a single explosion or 3 melee hits will also do the job. However, you can combine them, so hitting them twice and then shooting at them from a safer location is possible.\n\n### FINKA\n\n#### ADRENAL SURGE\n\n-   Weapon reload speed increase bonus removed.\n-   Clears the shields' Suppressive Fire debuff. Reduces its effect by 50% if applied while affected by Adrenal Surge.\n\nWe have removed the weapon reload bonus from the Adrenal Surge to make the bonus on the new Angled Grip more appealing. Without speeding-up the animations and with the possibility of both effects stacking, the new attachment wasn't as impactful as we wanted.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### WEAPON CLASSES\n\n#### GENERAL\n\n-   New classes: Revolver, Sniper Rifle, Slug Shotgun.\n\n#### LIGHT MACHINE GUNS\n\n-   Movement speed reduced by 10%.\n\n#### ADS TRANSITION\n\n-   Normalized and simplified ADS curve transitions:\n  -   Fast: Handguns, Revolvers, Shotguns.\n  -   Medium: Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles.\n  -   Slow: Machine Pistols, Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles, Light Machine Guns, Slug Shotguns.\n\n#### ADS SPEED\n\n-   Reduced ADS speed from idle/walk stances:\n  -   Handgun: 240ms (from 200).\n  -   Revolver: 240ms (from 200).\n  -   Machine Pistol: 380ms (from 280).\n  -   Submachine Gun: 460ms (from 300).\n  -   Assault Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Light Machine Gun: 560ms (from 450).\n  -   Marksman Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Sniper Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Shotgun: 340ms (from 250).\n  -   Slug Shotgun: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Hand Cannon: 240ms (from 200).\n-   Reduced ADS speed from sprint (same proportion).\n-   Launchers are also affected. The ADS Speed depends on their type of sight.\n\nWith the goal of increasing players' options, weapon customization, and accessibility, we have taken a look at all the weapons in the game and normalized their configuration according to their class. We have cleared all the exceptions and strange mixes, such as the Commando 9 that was a mix of AR-SMG and is now 100% an AR, so everyone will know what to expect from a weapon just by checking its class but while the classes are new the gameplay hasn't changed.\n\nWe have also taken a deeper look at the LMG class. We nerfed them significantly last year to address the LMG-meta, but now we can bring them back. Along with tweaks to specific weapons that are listed below, we are going to add a movement penalty to the whole class to compensate for their magazine capacity.\n\nClearing all the fundamentals has allowed us to expand on the Weapon Attachments System by adding new attachments and new types of bonuses, as you will see below.\n\nThe current speed makes peeking a corner too advantageous, entering danger should be properly judged and have risks. Therefore, we have reduced the ADS speed across all weapons. The new timings aim to reduce the strength of fast-peeking and return some advantage to holding an angle or repositioning. Additionally, we have simplified what determines the precision from hip fire to aiming down sights, leaving only 3 typologies:\n\n-   Fast: Most of the precision is gained during the initial part of the transition (antilogarithmic). You can shoot with relatively good precision during the aiming animation.\n-   Medium: The precision is increased at a constant pace (linear).\n-   Slow: Most of the precision is gained during the final part of the transition (logarithmic). During the animation, it is more likely to still miss some shots on the target because it takes longer to transition from hip fire accuracy to ADS\n\n### SIGHTS\n\n#### IRON SIGHT\n\nCategory: No sight.\n-   Magnification: 1.0x.\n-   Added +10% ADS speed bonus.\n\n#### SIGHT\n\nCategory: Non-magnifying.\n-   Magnification: 1.0x.\n-   Added +5% ADS speed bonus.\n\n#### MAGNIFIED\n\nCategory: Magnifying.\n-   Magnification: ~2.5x.\n-   Attackers' distribution:\n  -   Available on every weapon.\n-   Defenders' distribution:\n  -   9mm C1: Frost.\n  -   P10 Roni: Mozzie.\n  -   9x19SVN: Tachanka.\n  -   ACS12: Alibi, Maestro, Azami.\n  -   AR-15.50: Tubarao.\n  -   BOSG.12.2: Vigil.\n  -   Mk 14 ERB: Aruni.\n  -   MP5K: Wamai.\n  -   MP5: Doc, Melusi, Rook.\n  -   P90: Doc, Rook.\n  -   TCSG12: Goyo, Kaid.\n  -   UMP45: Castle.\n  -   UZK50GI: Thorn.\n  -   Vector .45 ACP: Goyo.\n\n#### TELESCOPIC\n\nCategory: Magnifying.\n-   Magnification: ~3.5x.\n-   Available only on Attacking DMRs.\n\n#### RETICLES\n\n-   Increased middle dot size:\n  -   Holo A.\n  -   Holo C.\n  -   Red Dot C.\n  -   Magnified A.\n-   Reduced middle dot size:\n  -   Holo B.\n  -   Magnified C.\n\nA few years ago, using the sight with the highest magnification was the way to go, now the 1.5x is the default. We want sight selection to be an important decision based on your strategy for the round. So, we have reworked the entire attachment category.\n\nFirst off, we have made an existing option more meaningful. The \"None\" sight option is now Iron Sight and has a category, No Sight. You will aim faster if you choose Iron Sights, its shape will depend on the weapon, so there is a wide variety of options to explore and test if they fit your play style.\n\nSecondly, we have the Non-Magnifying category, which includes all the attachable sights without magnification. This is a category you already know and is where you can find the Red Dot, Holographic, and Reflex sights. This category will also have an ability, and similarly No Sight, they will increase your ADS speed but with a lower percentage as they are generally more comfortable to use. We have also detected a couple of reticles that were slightly better than the rest, so we have re-balanced them.\n\nFinally, we have reorganized all the Magnifying scopes. There are fewer magnifications, making the choice and differences between each one more meaningful. We have kept only two, now called Magnified and Telescopic. For each scope type, you will have a few options to choose depending on which one is more comfortable for you. We have also tweaked the Magnified A and C reticles, so the options are balanced.\n\nThe Magnifying scopes' distribution has also changed. We believe that now every sight has its pros and cons, so we can be less restrictive with their distribution:\n\n-   The Magnified will be available on every Assault Rifle, Submachine Gun, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Rifle, and Slug Shotgun in Attack.\n-   The Magnified will be available on every Slug Shotgun, Marksman Rifle, and in some designated Submachine Gun in Defense (listed above).\n-   The Telescopic will be available on every Marksman Rifle in Attack.\n\nAll the changes listed here, will create a lot of possibilities and many new scenarios. This is a new beginning for the weapon attachments system. We are happy with the current proposal, but we will monitor everything closely and continue making adjustments if needed in future patches.\n\n### UNDER BARRELS\n\n#### LASER\n\n-   Removed Hip Fire bonus.\n-   Added +10% ADS speed bonus.\n\nThe Laser bonus has changed to ADS speed.\n\nNow that we are tweaking the ADS speed across all the weapons, we didn't want to have this bonus limited to only those with access to grips. The laser has been available on almost every weapon since Y6S3.0, so everyone can use it and benefit from its ability.\n\nAdditionally, the Laser has the downside of revealing your presence, so it made sense to pair it with one of the most aggressive bonuses.\n\n### GRIPS\n\n#### ANGLED GRIP\n\n-   Removed ADS speed bonus.\n-   Added +20% weapon reload speed.\n\n#### HORIZONTAL GRIP\n\n-   The \"None\" option is now called \"Horizontal Grip\".\n-   Added +5% movement speed bonus.\n\n#### VERTICAL GRIP\n\n-   Bonus reduced to +20% vertical recoil control (from +25%).\n\nWe have added a new option, the Horizontal Grip. Just as with the Iron Sight, it is a rework of the \"None\" grip option into a viable and meaningful choice. It will grant you extra mobility. Bear in mind that we are not making any operator move faster than they currently can, this attachment only allows you to move at the \"handgun\" speed but with your primary weapon, at the cost of sacrificing the other grip bonuses. \n\nThe Angled Grip has also been reworked, and now grants Weapon Reload speed, an exciting bonus for those weapons that need to reload often or have long animations.\n\nSilencers and Extended Barrels have been more popular since their respective reworks, so we have also reduced the recoil control bonus of the Vertical Grip, making equipping them a tougher decision.\n\nOnly weapons with access to the Grips section can make use of these options. By default, they are unavailable, and you must equip the attachment to get the ability. As an example, the MP5K doesn't have the Vertical Grip bonus, and the F2 doesn't have the Horizontal Grip bonus.\n\n### BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\n#### BASE\n\nMovement:\n- Every operator equipped with a Ballistic Shield will keep it in front while sprinting.\n- An operator equipped with a Ballistic Shield can push through a barricade without having to hit them twice. Does not work from rappel.\n\nWeapon handling:\n- The ability to hip fire has been removed.\n- Reduced accuracy during the shield unequip animation.\n- During the ADS animation with a shield, the weapon will not shoot until it is pointing forward.\n- Reduced ADS time to 0.5 seconds walking and 0.55 seconds sprinting (from 0.6 both).\n- The reload animation is performed behind the shield.\n- The reload will now be triggered automatically when the weapon runs out of bullets.\n\nMelee:\n- New defensive melee animation.\n- The melee now deals pushback and 65hp damage (from 100% DBNO).\n-   New gadget throw animation from behind the shield (the animation will arrive in a later update).\n-   New gadget trigger animation from behind the shield.\n-   The Ballistic Shield remains equipped while escorting the Hostage.\n-   Touching fire will trigger the guard break with 40% intensity (same as electricity).\n\n#### FREE LOOK\n\n*Please note: The \"Freelook Throw\" animation has been disabled temporarily and will be fixed in a later update.  *\n\n-   Can hold the FREE LOOK button to check your surroundings while keeping the Ballistic Shield aiming forward.\n-   Can throw gadgets towards the direction you are looking.\n\n#### SUPPRESSIVE FIRE\n\n-   The operator will be suppressed if the Ballistic Shield receives too many bullet impacts.\n  -   Trigger: 10 bullets.\n  -   Maximum intensity: 40 bullets.\n  -   Fall off: 7 seconds.\n-   While suppressed, the operator cannot sprint. \n-   While suppressed, the visibility is reduced according to the effect's intensity. \n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Blitz\n-   Fuze\n-   Montagne\n-   Clash (only suppressive fire)\n\nWe have reimagined the mechanics around the ballistic shields in the game. Focusing on the shield being safer to use and support orientated at range as well as more threatening in close quarters. This will allow shield ops to take ground, provide more intel and control combat engagements with greater efficiency.  \n\nThis update also helps realign our ballistic shields to follow two core Siege design principles: \n\n1) To be lethal with a gun, you need to be vulnerable.    \n2) Actions from Player's direct input are not to be randomized. They are to be deliberate, consistent and reliable.\n\nRemoving the hip fire feature from the ballistic shields serves these principles.\n\nLike all other weapons and equipment, it is our goal to make sure every item in our operator's armories has a role and is viable when deployed with creative strategies and teamplay. We will be monitoring these changes and bringing more updates to our shields in the future.\n\n### LMG-E\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Ram\n-   Zofia\n\nThe LMG-E's recoil is one of the hardest to control in R6, especially if the player tries to empty its magazine without releasing the trigger. We've seen how this weapon's popularity and performance has decreased during the last few seasons, and that is why we want to make the recoil less challenging for players. The new Movement Speed Reduction for the LMG Class allows us to employ meaningful changes. That said, due to its huge magazine and high rate of fire, the LMG-E recoil will still be one of the hardest to control within the LMG Class.\n\n### 6P41\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Finka\n-   Fuze\n\nThe 6P41 was one of the highest performance weapons in the game during Y7, due to the combination of great fire power and a strong operator like Finka behind it. In the last few years, we've released several changes that have made the weapon one of the hardest to control which consequently makes it perform below average. The addition of the Movement Speed Reduction for LMGs allows us to restore some of its former glory by setting an easier to control recoil, this should make this weapon a more balanced and appealing option for players.\n\n### M249\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Capitao\n-   Attacker Recruit\n\nCapitao's M249 has maintained very similar performance when compared with its loadout alternative the PARA-308, but its popularity has been way lower. The inclusion of the new Movement Speed Reduction paired with updated recoil should make it easier to control, this change aims to increase the popularity of the M249, which should invite Capitao players to spend more time with his LMG.\n\n### M249 SAW\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Gridlock\n\nGridlock's LMG is currently in a good spot in terms of performance and pick rate when compared to its alternative the F90. The new LMG Class Movement Speed reduction could disrupt this loadout equilibrium, to avoid this we are making the M249 SAW recoil easier to control.\n\n### G8A1\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Amaru\n-   IQ\n\nThe G8A1 is the most picked and best performing weapon in Amaru's loadout but it has remained as an under performing and under picked weapon for IQ for a long time.\n\nThe inclusion of the Speed Reduction for LMGs gives us more space to make the G8A1 recoil a little easier to control, this should ensure that this weapon retains and potentially improves its performance and appeal to players.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":18,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3jBlCdtRBQx2sCjmY2umNu/y9s1-designers-notes","date":"2024-02-26T10:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"427BHmfNfGsFcHrBxLu1D5","title":"“I was there when Rainbow began.

His main mission in life is simple: to create the greatest soldiers the world has ever seen. DEIMOS is making his debut in the new season Operation DEADLY OMEN because a match against him is just that.\n\nDEIMOS is a tracking Operator who uses his DeathMARK, to reveal his opponents' locations while also revealing his own. The DeathMARK makes both players aware of each other's position until time runs out or one player has met their demise.  DeathMARK and DEIMOS are a match made in heaven or hell depending on where you stand, both unrelenting as they force confrontation. His 44 Vendetta is his only weapon compatible to use concurrently with DeathMARK and is great for when he needs to get the job done.\n\nDeathMARK isn't his only tool of termination, he can take out opponents with his AK-74M or M590A1. With 2 HEALTH and 2 SPEED DEIMOS is for players who love to strategize and want to outsmart their prey. His collection of weapons also makes him a great choice for Front-Line players, with confidence and the gun skills to back it up. If you're playing against DEIMOS, you must rise to the challenge or be eliminated.\n\nA considerable opponent and soldier to his core DEIMOS will force Defenders to play by his rules. If you have what it takes to counter him; TUBARÃO or VIGIL will make for an interesting match. TUBARÃO's ZOTO CANNISTER can deactivate the DeathMARK temporarily; however, in doing so they will limit utility and movement. VIGIL, on the other hand, is better equipped to counter DEIMOS as he can use the ERC-7 to counteract the DeathMARK. No matter who you may choose to go against this aggressive Operator, DEIMOS and his DeathMARK are here to prove that you can run, but you certainly can't hide.\n\nStrike fear into the hearts of Defenders when you play DEIMOS, available on the Test Server starting on February 26, 2024.\n\n\"Bring DEIMOS on an operation? No way in hell.\" -- Captain Jordan \"Thermite\" Trace, Redhammer Squad Leader.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","game-updates"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/427BHmfNfGsFcHrBxLu1D5/i-was-there-when-rainbow-began-ill-be-there-when-it-ends-deimos","date":"2024-02-26T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1Zo3SN6YLn05kMy2f6kwb6","title":"ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – FEBRUARY 2024","abstract":"Check out our latest Anti-Cheat Status Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3cSHb0IfGHiK9bVPH3X6Ff/1fa48cb0fec2fc22c58b8651a25b410d/Anti-cheat_header_960x540.png","content":"## CURRENT CHEATING LANDSCAPE\n\nToday, we'll share what our Player Protection team is doing to reinforce our anti-cheat and security systems, in order to protect the player experience.\n\nWe recently [acknowledged](https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1752006229642097037?s=20) the increased frustration that players have felt lately regarding cheating. It is clear that __the landscape of cheating in Siege is evolving__. For example, the QB System on PC is directly impacting cheat creation by making new cheats more difficult to create. It has been extremely successful in shaking up the cheating ecosystem with some cheat providers leaving or shutting down. However, new solutions and additional security measures can often act as double-edged swords; we deter less experienced cheat makers, but those that are well implanted will work harder to release new functional and undetectable cheats. This is why fighting cheats is a continuous endeavor.\n\nWe've now made a concentrated push to guarantee the necessary resources that Siege needs, and as part of this, we have created a special task force. We call this task force our Strike Team, supporting Player Protection with anti-cheat and security in Siege. This strike team has brought experts from multiple fields together in order to accelerate our ability to fine tune our anti-cheat solutions and target the most prolific cheats head-on.\n\n### PREVENTING CHEAT FEATURES AND EXPLOITS\n\nWe know that there are undetected cheats and gameplay exploits currently live in the game which are leading to a deteriorated gameplay experience. This is why we've implemented a strike team to tackle some of the most problematic cheats and exploits currently working in the game. It's crucial however that we not only react to cheats but also work to make cheat creation more difficult, and to this end our strike team has also been working on adding further encryptions throughout the game.\n\n### CHEATS ADDRESSED\n\nWe've addressed a number of cheats over the recent months with updates going live with Y8S4.3.\n\n__ADDRESSED CHEATS & EXPLOITS__\n\n- Various navigation cheats.\n- Various shooting-related cheats.\n- Various griefing cheats.\n- Various drone-related cheats.\n\nAs well as this, we've identified a prevalent cheat provider which led to a large ban wave and contributed to over 9,000 cheaters banned in January 2024, and 10,000 bans within a rolling 30-day period.\n\n## ANTI-CHEAT & BAN SYSTEMS\n\nLet's take a look at some of our anti-cheat and security systems, how they're working for us now, and what we're doing moving forward.\n\nTo start with, we want to assure you that our __anti-cheat solutions are always active__ and are only ever temporarily disabled to resolve issues which could affect our ability to protect legitimate players. Once resolved the affected system is then [reactivated](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1603102530678173696).\n\nWe do not deactivate our security or anti-cheat measures such as the QB System or MouseTrap for any prolonged amount of time, with BattlEye always remaining active.\n\n### MOUSETRAP\n\n__WORKAROUNDS__\n\nIn Year 8, we fixed a number of workarounds that were enabling spoofers to avoid or reduce their chances of detection, though we are aware that some players are still able to avoid the full effects of our system. We are working hard to counter these remaining workarounds and we are confident that you'll see further reductions in spoofing soon.\n\n__EFFECTIVENESS__\n\nMouseTrap continues to find, track, and penalize players who use mouse and keyboard on console through the use of spoofing devices and has remained active and effective throughout Year 8. The usage of spoofing devices which saw a drop on the release of MouseTrap has continued to trend at this lower rate since its release. Our data also shows that players do swap to controller if viable MouseTrap workarounds are not available, making a better experience for everyone.\n\n__MOUSETRAP UPDATES__\n\nWe are currently investigating new solutions to detect more types of spoofing adapters, and we've recently pushed an update to MouseTrap to further increase its effectiveness while ramping up its effects.\n\nIn this update we have:\n\n- Optimized our detection thresholds to identify more mouse and keyboard players on console.\n- Fined-tuned maximum latency penalties setting for the remainder of the season.\n\nThese changes will allow MouseTrap to detect even more players who are using mouse and keyboard on console, while adding high latency sooner.\n\nAs well as this, we are currently implementing additional in-game warning feedback for detected players and are developing an additional MouseTrap feature which will help to further level out the playing field. This feature will have a further positive impact on the match-to-match experience of console players. We will share more information on this important update during the Six Invitational.\n\n### QB SYSTEM\n\nAt its core, the purpose of the QB System is to make cheat creation more tedious, difficult, and costly, creating an unfavorable environment for cheat creators and sellers. QB is also beneficial when it comes to bans, having the ability to detect those who attempt to bypass it. We've already seen cheat creators giving up on Siege due to the increased effort that is now required for basic cheat development. It's made waves in the cheat market while having a great impact on Siege.\n\nAfter the successful launch of the QB System however, it became clear that we did not have the right long-term support in place that was required to ensure the system's continued effectiveness. We've now changed our approach and have committed to regular updates for the QB System going forward.\n\nWe are now developing new iterations which will be coming in Year 9, and in the meantime, we continue to fine-tune and further strengthen this innovative security system. QB is a solid system for Siege, and we're making sure that it's receiving the resources needed in order to maximize its performance.\n\nWe're excited to share more information on our advancements with the QB System later this year.\n\n### BANS - DATA BANS + BATTLEYE\n\n__BANS NUMBERS__\n\nHere we have our latest ban data, covering the last 3 months. We can see that while we had over 9,000 bans in January, the previous month of December was less successful in terms of detections and bans. This was due to new blatant cheats becoming available, most of which were not detectable during December, resulting in fewer bans and increased frustration for players. With our team focused on the cheats that are being used right now, we aim to see similar results to January in the near future.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – FEBRUARY 2024 - bans](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3rEwpPLQVxdZrvCz1LWQh5/5cf11d6ebfc3a9e192233dc2dfe04832/R6_BanChart_Nov-Jan24.jpg)\n\n__DATA BANS__\n\nSince their introduction, Data Bans have been a great success for Siege, finding illegitimate players that weren't already being found by our systems working at the forefront. However, __we fully recognize that there is room for improvement, with some high stat cheaters remaining undetected.__\n\nOur goal with Data Bans is to ensure that we can find as many cheaters as possible while continuing to protect our honest players. At the moment, we are working to __refine our data models__ by making use of additional player data points. This process will result in a more granular player overview, allowing us to increase the precision of the underlying system and in return boost its potency. As we continue to optimize we'll be able to adjust our thresholds, casting a wider net with full confidence, and finding and banning more cheaters that may have been going undetected.\n\nThere's more to come on Data Bans. We're also currently __developing a machine learning solution__ which will aim to broaden our ability to detect cheaters in Siege.\n\nWe'll be sharing more on this in a future update.\n\n__BATTLEYE__\n\nBattlEye is the system that makes up for most of our cheater bans. Like our other forms of anti-cheat, __BattlEye is never turned off__, remaining active at all times, finding and banning thousands of cheaters each month.\n\nAs some of you may have noticed, in-game mentions of BattlEye have been removed. This change is to make sure that cheaters aren't getting information on how or what they were detected by; even minor details such as the mention of a ban system can play a role in the creation of new and undetectable cheats. This small change will help in reducing the chances of our anti-cheat systems being bypassed by cheaters and cheat makers.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – FEBRUARY 2024 - 2023 bans](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2rFmB5Wxj9DS0krqeLmYRV/0363386ef47f7c03afe564477c0fd9f6/100k.Bans.960x540.png)\n\n## CONCLUDING OUR PLANS & VISION\n\nWe know that cheaters have a big impact on Siege and everyone's enjoyment of the game, which is why we're boosting our anti-cheat resources. We already have results to show for this in January, and we have much more to come.\n\nWe are focused on strengthening our anti-cheat tools, tackling current high impact cheats, and ultimately giving players the experience that they log on for.\n\nMake sure to watch the Six Invitational for the Year 9 Season 1 and Year 9 reveals on Saturday February 24th and Sunday February 25th, for further information on our Player Protection plans!","categories":["anti-cheat","rainbow-six-siege","dev-blogs"],"readTime":8,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1Zo3SN6YLn05kMy2f6kwb6/anticheat-status-update-february-2024","date":"2024-02-15T16:31:00.000Z"},{"id":"5plhBU3RgPKheHPernoEWK","title":"Y8S4.3 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S4.3!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2oloPdm7LmljbCWmTUSnN6/aa61c483fd7e69526f39e3ec2ce476e8/Y8S4.3_Article.jpg","content":"You can find here the updates and fixes for the Y8S4.3 patch.\n\n## Y8S4.3 Patch Size\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 0.4 GB\n- Steam: 0.3 GB\n- Xbox One: 0.6 GB\n- Xbox Series X: 0.7 GB\n- PlayStation 4: 0.5 GB\n- PlayStation 5: 0.7 GB\n\n# TWEAKS AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\n## GAME HEALTH\n\n### GAME STABILITY\n\nOverall stability of the game has been improved.\n\n### FPS IMPROVEMENTS\n\nWe've addressed FPS drop issue that occurs when Tubarao's Zoto Canister is used.

Blowtorch.\n-   Electrical Insulation effect extended by 1.5 seconds after Canister destruction. \n\nWe've seen how Tubarão's Zoto Canisters can be used with great success during his time on the live server. Although we're still monitoring his position within the meta as the season progresses and players learn to play and counter play him, we did want to quickly readjust an aspect of his ability following feedback we've received. Reducing the amount Zoto Canisters to 3 will mean players will need to use them more strategically throughout the round. The freezing effect will no longer cause any delay to Maverick's D.I.Y. blowtorch to better position him as a counter to Tubarão. The powerful synergy between Tubarão and Ops like Bandit, or Kaid is something we strongly believe in as it's an integral part of what makes Siege and its operators so interesting. That being said, we did observe that in his current state, those synergies left little room for counter play from attackers. The electrical insulation on metal objects affected by the Zoto Canisters previously lasted only as long as the Canister was active on a surface. The added 1.5 seconds of electrical insulation allow attacking teams with strong coordination a chance to respond and forces the defense to be much more precise in the execution of their strategy if they want to succeed in denying the breach.\n\n### ACE\n\n#### S.E.L.M.A. AQUA BREACHER\n\n-   Fuse time: Increase to 4 seconds (from 3.2)\n\nAce doesn't have many downsides. The S.E.L.M.A. is safe to use, quick to explode, fast to use in succession, opens a relatively big hole, and can destroy bulletproof utility. Its main downside is that it can be destroyed during the breaching process to prevent it from creating a navigable hole. But when compared with the downsides of other Hard Breach Operators, this is clearly not enough:\n\n-   Thermite: Only 1 at a time, must be close to the wall, is exposed while using the charge, but creates a bigger hole.\n-   Hibana: Slow deployment, slow triggering, but can be used from very far and has a lot of flexibility.\n-   Maverick: Requires quite a bit of time, must be close to the wall, is incredibly exposed while using it, but he doesn't have counters.\n\nBy increasing the fuse time, we want to give defenders a better chance to prevent the breach when a lot of resources are dedicated to protecting the wall. The extra time will increase the synchronization required between the breacher enabler (Thatcher, Impact EMP, etc.) and Ace to open an actively defended wall successfully.\n\n### KAPKAN\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Bulletproof Camera.\n-   Removed Impact Grenades.\n\nKapkan has a huge impact on every round regardless of the number of traps triggered. The way attackers must approach the map changes after spotting him or triggering one of his traps. They have to slow down and start paying attention to every window and door frame to ensure they won't blow up. The last buff to the EDDs made this psychological effect even stronger because you may not get a second chance.\n\nWe considered that he already has enough tools to make attackers lose time and the Impact Grenades are helping him be more elusive, allowing him to create rotations on the fly and make attackers invest even more time hunting him through a minefield.\n\n### MAVERICK\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Smoke Grenades.\n\nWe are aware that Maverick is a bit situational without Frag Grenades, and despite not having hard counters, there are not too many situations that justify bringing him over other Hard Breachers and an EMP source. It is dangerous to rely on him as the main breacher because of the time and danger he is in while doing the job. And as a secondary breacher, someone more flexible, such as Ace or Hibana (even the Hard Breach Charge), is usually a less limiting choice for the team.\n\nWe hope that the Smoke Grenades can help him be more appealing as a secondary breacher and increase his flexibility, so he can also help with site execution, or even cover himself while breaching through reinforcements.\n\n### THUNDERBIRD\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Deployable Shield.\n\nWe finished her transition to a more supportive role with the latest tweaks to the Kona Station and loadout changes back in S2.0 but it seems like her utility is not appealing enough.\n\nThe addition of the Deployable Shield will allow her to create genuine strongholds for defenders by herself. The protection from the shield and the backup from the Kona Stations can make any defender in these positions a hard target to deal with. You can add a few Active Defense Systems or Mag-Net Systems to prevent the shield from getting destroyed too easily and attackers will have a tough time trying to move you out of position.\n\nAdditionally, the SPAS-15 is also improved to encourage her to contribute to site setup.\n\nWe believe that these changes can make her more appealing to players who like to experiment with different setups and help their teammates from the backline.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### SPAS-15\n\n#### RECOIL (PC & Console)\n\n-   First shot kick reduced.\n-   Lateral recoil increased.\n-   Elastic time increased.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Caveira\n-   Thunderbird\n\nAutomatic Shotguns were left on the sidelines during the Shotgun rework. We were aware that some of the changes introduced could be a bit scary at first sight, so we wanted to be sure that we didn't enter a new Shotgun meta era by buffing the automatic ones too much.\n\nDespite this, we don't have plans to touch them again in the near future (we want to see how everything settles), As we wanted to buff Thunderbird, we found it a good opportunity to make a slight tweak to the SPAS-15. Depending on the effect of these changes, we might give similar treatment to the other automatic shotguns.\n\nWe are reducing the first shot kick, which eases landing consecutive shots on the target and taking full advantage of the automatic mode. On the other hand, we are increasing the lateral recoil and adding a clear tendency to the left, which also reduces its tendency upwards.\n\n### G36C\n\n#### RECOIL (PC & Console)\n\n-   Vertical recoil increased.\n-   Horizontal recoil increased.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Ash\n-   Iana\n\nBoth the R4C and ARX-200 have received balancing changes to reduce their power level in the last few years, this has made players gravitate towards the G36C. That combined with Ash and Iana being two of the strongest fraggers on Attack have made the G36C the weapon with the highest Kill Death Ratio on Attack. This alone isn't an issue; it is a strong weapon in the hands of Operators dedicated to \"kills\", but the difference between this weapon and other high KDR weapons in the game is too high. Access to the 1.5x sight is an element that strongly affects this weapon's power level, but also differentiates it from its Loadout competitors the R4-C and ARX-200.\n\nWith all of that in mind we've decided to modify its recoil. It will be harder to control on every axis which will require players to use more \"recoil control\" attachments and increase the difficulty of long-range engagements while using the 1.5x.\n\n### SMG-11\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Damage: Reduced to 32hp (from 35).\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Amaru\n-   Mute\n-   Smoke\n-   Solis\n\nFor a very long time, the SMG-11 has been the weapon with the lowest Time to Kill among all automatic weapons by far. The change in damage will put it more in line with all the other weapons, while remaining among the fastest. The change will increase the bullets required to kill 1-armor operators by 1, rewarding precision and punishing spraying and praying. \n\nWe could have reduced the damage even more without affecting the TTKs, but we want it to remain appealing enough to pair with primary shotguns.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1VJt41BV7BPIuQURfavThd/y8s42-designers-notes","date":"2024-01-22T20:39:00.000Z"},{"id":"6uMSX3GcrTsISxlA5CMmY","title":"Holiday Pack 2023","abstract":"Happy Holidays from the Rainbow Six Siege team!

Here we'll be covering what the full release means for players, how it will continue to improve, and the actions we've recently taken to further protect players.\n\n## PHILOSOPHY & GOAL\n\nWith the Reputation System, we are staying true to our core pillars:\n\n- __MITIGATE & DETER BEHAVIOR__\n- __PREVENT & ADDRESS__\n- __FEEDBACK & GUIDANCE__\n\nFollowing our core principles, we aim to shield our players against toxicity, curb in-game disruptions and negative behavior, encourage \"pro-social\" behavior, reform or remove toxic players, and more, while ultimately reinforcing the cooperative nature of Siege.\n\nOur guiding philosophy with the Reputation System itself is that each player should know why they have a particular Reputation Standing, what they can do to modify their playstyle or interactions and improve their position in the Reputation System. We want to ensure that players have the proper tools available to them and the opportunities to make any necessary adjustments. This release of the Reputation System marks an essential step for us, and with player feedback being a crucial part of our strategy, we will be listening to your thoughts and concerns.\n\n## SEASON 4 - WHAT'S NEW?\n\n### REVEAL RECAP\n\nBefore we delve into the latest Reputation System update, if you didn't see our Operation Deep Freeze reveal panel, we've got a recap covering what's been added in Y8S4 and what to expect in the future.\n\n<https://youtu.be/f2hqIkZSYe8>\n\n### GRACE PERIOD\n\nThe Reputation System has been released with updated features and UI, and an ongoing grace period. This grace period means that __there will currently be no impact__ based on a player's Reputation Standing alone, giving players an opportunity to become accustomed to the updated system and to adjust any behaviors before the impacts go live. In the meantime, we will be monitoring the system, collecting feedback, and performing calibrations, ensuring the Reputation System is ready before the grace period is lifted. Note however, that __this grace period does not affect currently implemented penalties__ such as communication penalties and reverse friendly fire that are already live.\n\n### REPUTATION CENTER UPDATE\n\nWe've updated the Reputation Center to bring even more information to players. Now you'll be able to see your biggest opportunities for improvement, the impacts that your Reputation Standing could have (after the grace period), and more.\n\nTwo new sections in the updated Reputation Center are Tips and Guides. Here we're sharing tips that can help players to improve their Reputation Standing and on their way to becoming great Siege community members and players.\n\n![[R6S] Reputation System: Activation & More - Rep Center](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6CQEEMlCxuyvo8I9iygZnq/0190ec1686afb0e49d2e944c9fd5c514/RepCenter.960x540.png)\n\nWith this release you'll start to see notifications with information about changes to your Reputation Standing. Players will be notified of Reputation Standing adjustments, as well as any possible effects current behavior could have on their Reputation Standing in the future. As part of these notifications, we'll also share the impacts that a player could face once the grace period has come to a close.\n\n![[R6S] Reputation System: Activation & More - notification](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4OTB9eWIFtsoERDNsHUTQY/bd5cfee06e029cc07b7b1bb6734a0361/Notifications.960x540.png)\n\n### NEW IMPACTS\n\nOnce the grace period has ended, there will be a range of positive and negative impacts depending on a player's Reputation Standing. We will share further updates in the future regarding when the grace period will end.\n\nHaving positive and good behaviour could bring:\n\n- Improved Renown gain.\n- Increased experience points.\n- Bonus Alpha Pack progress.\n- Unique rewards.\n\nAlternatively, negative and unwanted behavior could lead to:\n\n- Reduced experience and rewards.\n- Ranked rewards locks.\n- Playlist locks.\n\nThese negative impacts have been specifically chosen to help players to rehabilitate and adapt their behaviors in order to have those effects reversed or removed later in their journey.\n\n__PLAYLIST & RANKED REWARDS LOCKS - \\[NOT ACTIVE DURING CURRENT GRACE PERIOD\\]__\n\nPlayers who find their playlists restricted will need to increase their Reputation Standing in order to make them available once more. This means that players who have the lock enabled will actively need to change their behaviors in the remaining game modes, resulting in those good behaviors being reinforced.\n\nThe Ranked rewards lock will behave similarly to the playlist lock, and those who receive a lock on the upcoming Ranked rewards will also have opportunities to rectify the situation. In the following season players who increase their Reputation Standing to Respectable, will have their previous rewards granted.\n\n## PROTECTING PLAYERS AND CREATORS FROM REPORT ABUSERS\n\nIn-game reporting is incredibly helpful to our Player Protection team. Your in-game reports help to make our automatic detection more robust; they assist in investigations carried out by our Player Protection team, and aid in creating a safer playspace for everyone.\n\nWe do also want to reiterate to players that while in-game reporting continues to be an invaluable tool for our Player Protection team to leverage, __players will not be sanctioned based on in-game reports alone.__\n\nWe want players to know they can make use of the in-game reporting system, though we know that there are others looking to misuse these reporting tools as a method of abuse. Following your feedback, we've updated our system to better account for and to prevent report spamming. Critically however, players with poor behavior will still be able to be reported correctly, resulting in possible Reputation Penalties or game sanctions. In the future, we will continue to strengthen our validations while building upon and creating new safeguards, further increasing the robustness of our systems.\n\n## REPUTATION STANDING ACCURACY\n\nCurrently, the Reputation System already takes advantage of a whole host of positive and negative stats including in-game reports, Commendations, Reverse Friendly Fire, abandon abuse, and more, with the use of safeguarding logic. While these have given us enough data overall to provide a fair representation of a player's behavior, we know that we can further increase precision with additional data points covering other common player behaviors. To this end, we're working on including more granular data to define a player's Reputation with even more accuracy.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe new improvements we are introducing this season should greatly reduce occurrences of players finding undeserved reports on their Misconduct page, while also stopping illegitimate Reputation Penalties in worst case scenarios. If you continue to experience any issue with the Reputation System after this update, please report it via [R6Fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/).\n\nYou should expect to see additional adjustments and communications in the months to come around balancing, additional actions and protections, and Reputation Standing impacts, as we work to create a system that works best for everyone. We are always listening to your feedback and working on improvements to better reflect our goals; we want to make sure we're achieving the right results by rewarding positive and reputable players, while helping other players to improve their behavior.\n\nAs we continue into Y8S4 Operation Deep Freeze, keep in mind that the Reputation System will remain in a grace period. During that time, you'll get to see the impact of your in-game actions in the Reputation Center __without having the effects applied__. None of the impacts highlighted in the Reputation Center will be activated until this system is fully balanced and officially released, however, Reputation Penalties which are already live such as voice or written chat Penalties will continue to work as usual.\n\nWe want Siege to not only be a game of competitiveness and strategy, but also of joy and comfort. The Reputation System forms an essential component of our strategy to protect players, and we remain dedicated to our mandate of creating a welcoming environment for all.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","toxicity","dev-blogs"],"readTime":7,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/22JLMFeayzuamhb7YKbAjm/reputation-system-activation-more","date":"2023-12-18T14:30:00.000Z"}]
