Following the update in Y9S1, the rates shifted to 42% explosives, 29% melee, and 28% bullets. However, during the season, explosive usage increased while bullet damage decreased. As a result, we made adjustments in the mid-season patch, but the usage of bullets didn't even match the numbers we had at the beginning of the season.\n\nTo address this, we've decided to further boost the damage modifiers. After analyzing a longer data period, we're less concerned about barriers being too vulnerable to bullets at close range. Melee attackers continue to be a more efficient and quicker method for barrier destruction. Our goal is to make barrier destruction more viable from longer distances, taking into account the damage drop-off of weapons. We aim for a more balanced usage of bullets and explosives.\n\n#### KIBA BARRIER\n\n- Increased damage received by Handguns:\n  - 20% by Small calibers (e.g. USP40).\n  - 30% by Medium calibers (e.g. M45 MEUSOC).\n  - 20% by High calibers (e.g. D-50).\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Revolvers.\n- Increased by 30% the damage received by Machine Pistols.\n- Increased damage increased by Submachine Guns:\n  - 30% by Small calibers (e.g. Mx4 Storm).\n  - 20% by Medium calibers (e.g. K1A).\n  - 20% by High calibers (e.g. UZK50GI).\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Assault Rifles.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Light Machine Guns.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Designated Marksman Rifles.\n- Increased by 20% the damage received by Sniper Rifles.\n  - 150% by CSRX 300.\n\n### BUCK\n\nOver the past couple of years, attackers have gained additional tools to counter defenders' bulletproof utility (such as Brava and Ram) and increased access to explosives (including the additional Gonne-6 and Frag Grenades). As time has passed, many of the stronger defenders have already been addressed by adding more non-explosive counters (like Azami and Fenrir). Therefore, we believe that Buck's Gonne-6 is overshadowing other operators who specialize in explosive capabilities.\n\nOur intention for Buck is to maintain his focus on environmental destruction and vertical play. We feel that the Gonne-6 is unnecessary for him to excel in this area.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n\n### ECHO\n\nDespite the increased pick rate of the Supernova (approximately from 5% to 20%), our intention to position it as an alternative to the usual site architects has unfortunately resulted in it being underutilized. Consequently, we have decided to restore its armor and speed ratings and reintroduce the Magnified Scopes into the MP5SD. The new sights are designed to encourage a more passive playstyle, which should synergy well with him staying on drones at a distance from the action and hold long angles if needed.\n\nWe acknowledge that these adjustments alone may not be sufficient to increase Echo's presence substantially, so we are investigating additional changes for the Yokai drones in the background.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n- Armor: 3 (from 2).\n- Speed: 1 (from 2).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5SD: Added Magnified Scopes to sights options.\n\n### ELA\n\nAs we are adjusting the killing potential of Melusi and Wamai, we have identified an opportunity to enhance her roaming capabilities to fill the gap that those operators might be leaving. Given the recent additions to the defensive roaster, Ela's role has become more constrained. To address this, we have decided to reintroduce her Impact Grenades, allowing her greater mobility and additional tools against Ballistic Shields.\n\nEla's current lethality is significantly lower than it was in Year 3 when we initially removed the grenades. By reintroducing them, our goal is to make her gameplay more dynamic during the round without creating an overly oppressive experience for the attacking team.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary gadgets: Removed Observation Blocker. Added Impact Grenades.\n\n### GRIDLOCK\n\nDespite she has a lot of resources and each canister covering a relatively large area, defenders do not seem particularly scared when encountering them. And the punishment for ignoring them is not severe enough. Currently, an enemy only takes 3 ticks of damage when crossing a fully expanded canister, which is only 30 hit points. Furthermore, even if the covered area is extensive, it is unnecessary to destroy all deployed Trax devices to create a safer path, so only a few bullets are needed to invalidate them.\n\nTo address this, we plan to increase the damage dealt per second. This adjustment will make them more intimidating, prompting defenders to ensure that the path is clear before proceeding. With the new damage output, crossing the area will cost 45 hp, which should encourage defenders to play more cautiously and give attackers more time to react. We remain open to further adjustments if this value does not meet our expectation in practice.\n\n#### TRAX STINGERS\n\n- Damage: Increased to 15hp per second in movement (from 10).\n\n### MELUSI\n\nThe Magnified Scope has notably enhanced her efficiency in combat scenarios, even outperforming other operators with the MP5. Despite her being a 3-armor like Doc and Rook, we consider that she should be more focused on utility usage. Additionally, the introduction of other operators who can fulfill a similar role in a more flexible manner, such as Fenrir, has diminished her utility.\n\nThe proposed adjustments are designed to reduce her killing potential while expanding her contribution to team strategy. The additional resources will help her cover more space or double down in locations that might need more attention. Furthermore, the introduction of a secondary shotgun is intended to foster creativity and versatility preparing the defensive setup.\n\n#### BANSHEE SONIC DEFENSE\n\n- Max. resources: Increase to 4 (from 3).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5: Removed Magnified Scopes from sights options.\n- Secondary weapons: Added ITA12S.\n\n### WAMAI\n\nWhile the MP5K statistics do not currently raise immediate concerns, on the contrary, its efficiency went almost back to pre-Acog levels by the end of Season 1. The rising presence presents a pattern that can remind of past experiences with other operators, such as Alibi, Oryx, and Warden. While these operators weren't overwhelmingly overpowered in terms of stats, their significant presence - specifically the motivation to pick them - was perceived negatively, leading to concerns about game balance. In light of these considerations, we have decided to remove the Magnified Scope.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- MP5K: Removed Magnified Scopes from sights options.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":7,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6dN3Cvhf3lyZO52nAgcRuQ/y9s23-designers-notes","date":"2024-07-24T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"2EijZUDfWQQhiy68cGhhBD","title":"Y9S2.2 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S2.2!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/27hhh43r3tvngQsKQjdaEL/5318fce56af3c92b1e0528225ecb3cde/NEWS_PATCHNOTES_Y9S2_960x540.jpg","content":"Here you can find the updates and fixes for the Y9S2.2 patch.\n\n# Y9S2.2 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 1.26 GB\n- Steam: 857 MB\n- Xbox One: 1 GB\n- Xbox Series X: 1.4 GB\n- PlayStation 4: 1.46 GB\n- PlayStation 5: 1.28 GB\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n## GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED - Deadzone sensitivity doesn't apply calibration properly.\n\nFIXED - Operators can melee through Shields.\n\n## LEVEL DESIGN  \n\nFIXED - Drones can clip inside the wall located in EXT Valley on the Border map.\n\n## OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Ying's Candela ability has a low level of detail when held close to the operator.\n\n## USER EXPERIENCE\n\nFIXED - Drone's red scan ping doesn't display on Player's UI during preparation phase.\n\nFIXED - Dynamic play button text for Matchmaking is duplicated in the upper-left corner.\n\nFIXED - Some reticules for OTs-03 aren't affected by optic color and opacity changes.\n\nFIXED - Players can accept invites to ongoing custom online sessions.\n\nFIXED - \"Unlock with operator Specialties\" option is available after unlocking a pathfinder Operator with renown.\n\nFIXED - Hiding completed challenges can't be toggled by selecting the box under the Challenges tab.\n\nFIXED - Players can't scroll through the Battle Pass after accessing the Challenges tab.\n\n## AUDIO\n\nFIXED - Missing SFX when drones are destroyed while in support mode during the end of the round.\n\n## KNOWN ISSUE [PC]\nDue to a security update some third-party applications that interact with Siege may cause a crash on start-up.\n\nWe recommend temporarily disabling such applications until updated versions are released.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2EijZUDfWQQhiy68cGhhBD/y9s22-patch-notes","date":"2024-07-09T09:15:00.000Z"},{"id":"6WJt2qa45vHi0ST01V6vgJ","title":"Y9S2.1 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y9S2.1!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7rMXvWW5nDUvZ7x3tZPkO/a7f3fed908df1b8b9abeaacee65096d3/PATCHNOTES_Y9S2_960x540.jpg","content":"# Y9S2.1 PATCH SIZE\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n-   Ubisoft Connect: 1.05 GB\n-   Steam: 1.6 GB\n-   Xbox One: 0.8 GB\n-   Xbox Series X: 1 GB\n-   PlayStation 4: 1.29GB\n-   PlayStation 5: 887 MB\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n### GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED - Aiming down sight is cancelled when opening the scoreboard.\n\nFIXED - Reflex C reticle isn't centered on the Bearing 9.\n\nFIXED - Player's movement speed remains reduced if they reload while aiming down sight.\n\nFIXED - Players can eliminate more targets than what's needed in Target Drill on the Kafe Dostoyevsky map.\n\nFIXED - Claymores reappear after being destroyed by Electrified Barbed Wire.\n\n### LEVEL DESIGN\n\nFIXED - Drones can be hidden in the floor located at 2F Elevator Shaft on the Bank map.\n\nFIXED - Players are able to navigate on top of invisible collision located at EXT Docks Bridge on the Kanal map. \n\nFIXED - Flickering textures are present near ledges and on certain objects after destroying barricades when launching the Vulkan executable.\n\nFIXED - Grey carpets are difficult to destroy in 3F Cigar Balcony and 3F Cigar Lounge on the Kafe Dostoyevsky map.\n\nFIXED - Grey Carpets are difficult to destroy in 2F Pink Room on the House map.\n\n### OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Players can use Ram's BU-GI Auto Breacher to reach unintended areas.\n\nFIXED - Smoke Screen becomes bulletproof when using Sens' R.O.U.

While we have always wanted them to be playable and enjoyable in serious matches without being a meme, their potential had to be carefully managed due to the ability to have multiple Recruits on the same team. Additionally, the Recruit served as a safeguard for various systems, which meant that remastering it required also updating those systems.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that players have meaningful choices, the same as we did with the new Weapon Attachments; we want to make every gameplay option viable and interesting. Therefore, we have decided to make the remastered Recruits available in all playlists. However, only one can be selected per team, similar to any other Operator. We've updated their 3D models to help differentiate them during matches, and their loadouts are now fully customizable. As they remain excellent options for learning Siege's mechanics, they will be automatically unlocked for free at level 0.\n\nWe appreciate their versatility in team compositions, so we wanted to enhance this concept. Instead of splitting Secondary Gadgets between Ability and Gadget slots, they will now have access to every secondary utility from their faction in both slots. This flexibility allows for more strategic loadouts. However, using the same gadget in both slots is not allowed. For example, if you select Breach Charges in the Ability slot, you cannot select it again in the Gadget Slot.\n\nThis new approach also means that whenever we introduce a new Secondary Gadget, one of them will receive a buff and expand its tactical possibilities. Our guiding principle is that no Secondary Gadget should surpass an Operator's unique Ability, so more specialized Operators will always remain the most efficient choice.\n\nStriker, in particular, stands out as a versatile support on attack. You can assist Thermite with Impact EMP Grenades for breaching walls while using Hard Breach Charges to open the remaining hatches. Alternatively, protect your teammates by placing Claymores to block flanks and Smoke Grenades to control lines of sight. Or even take on the entry role with Frag Grenades and Stun Grenades while your team does the hard work.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n- Armor: 2\n\n- Speed: 2\n\n#### GADGET KIT (ABILITY)\n\n- Equips two gadgets instead of a gadget and an ability. Can select any attacking gadget on the team, but not the same twice.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Primary weapons: M4, M249\n\n- Secondary weapons: 5.7 USG, ITA12S\n\n### SENTRY\n\nSentry serves as the defensive counterpart to Striker. Their primary objective is to assist with site setup and provide any missing utility. If you require additional intel, consider bringing a Bulletproof Camera and Proximity Alarms. For enhanced map control, opting for a Deployable Shield and Barbed Wire would be more ideal.\n\nBASE STAT\n\n-   Armor: 2\n-   Speed: 2\n\nGADGET KIT (ABILITY)\n\n-   Equips two gadgets instead of a gadget and an ability. Can select any defensive gadget on the team, but not the same twice.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Primary weapons: Commando 9, M870\n-   Secondary weapons: C75 Auto, Super Shorty\n\n### FENRIR\n\nOur main goal is to provide Attackers with additional methods and opportunities to effectively handle the deployed mines while enhancing a more strategic environment without negating Fenrir's anti-rush capabilities.\n\nThe intention is to create an environment where Attackers feel less overwhelmed by Fenrir's presence. To achieve this, we have expanded the ways to counter the mines. Proper droning will be rewarded, allowing players to clear the mines progressively, whether they are active or not.\n\nFenrir's effectiveness will now be closely tied to the deployment type and gadget size, rather than relying mainly on bulletproof capacities. Similar to other devices, ensuring that the mines are discreet and strategically placed increases their effectiveness and survivability through the round. Additionally, the Observation Blocker will help Fenrir keep their location more challenging to discover. This will also reduce Fenrir's crowd control capabilities at the same time as it will replace the Barbed Wire.\n\nFenrir's utility now hinges on his survival. We encourage calculated risks and active engagement with the gadget. The new ticket system and adjusted number of resources require constant attention. Fenrir won't be capable of covering all the flanks and will need to react to the attackers' push to be efficient and capitalize on his utility. This updated behavior will also reduce the entry barrier for new players because you are not double-punished by a wrong or experimental placement.\n\n#### F-NATT DREAD MINE\n\n-   Max. resources (Mines): Reduced to 4 (from 5).\n-   Max. resources (Tickets): Reduced to 2 (from 3).\n-   An inactive mine is no longer bulletproof.\n-   Tickets are no longer lost when an active mine is destroyed. They will return to Fenrir's inventory.\n-   Disabling a mine automatically gets its ticket removed. They will return to Fenrir's inventory.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary gadgets: Added Observation Blocker. Removed Barbed Wire.\n\n### SOLIS\n\nWe have two primary objectives; First we would like to reduce Solis pressure over the attacking drones, specifically during the Preparation Phase. Second we would like to increase the amount of players' attention on SPEC-IO resource management.\n\nSolis has proven highly effective in hunting and neutralizing drones, which are crucial to build a successful Attack strategy. If Attackers cannot reveal the defenders' set up and position their drones inside the building the attack is likely to fail. Our goal is to strike a balance: Solis should remain relevant in this role while Attackers gain additional opportunities to fulfill their droning operations. With this changes Attackers will have less pressure to drone during the prep phase, but they will need to remain careful and aware of Solis during the Action Phase.\n\nAfter some data analysis and observing player behavior we've come to the conclusion that the SPEC-IO resources are too generous. Players usually do not consume all the energy available for the SPEC-IO, and when they do it the wait time until they are back online is quite short. The new SPEC-IO resources setting should encourage players to use the SPEC-IO in shorter bursts rather than keeping them on for long periods of time.\n\nWe also want to reduce a bit Solis' roaming capabilities, specifically her speed while moving through the map. We will replace her Impact Grenades with Proximity Alarms which will give her a new tool to gather intel from long distances. We encourage players to explore less commonly used weapon like the Shotgun ITA12L, adding it to their loadouts will grant Solis is still capable of causing destruction and executing vertical plays.\n\nWe've introduced a set of changes to create a more balanced Solis. However, this isn't her final form! We're closely monitoring the impact of these adjustments while simultaneously developing a fresh wave of changes that will specifically enhance her gadget detection and scanning mechanics. Stay tuned for further improvements.\n\n#### SPEC-IO ELECTRO-SENSOR\n\n- SPEC-IO goggles remain disabled during prep-phase.\n- SPEC-IO energy duration reduced to 10s (from 20s).\n- SPEC-IO needs to fully recharge before using it.\n- SPEC-IO Detection range 12m (from 15m).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary gadgets: Added Proximity Alarm. Removed Impact Grenades.\n\n### DEIMOS\n\nSince his release, Deimos has had relatively low pick and win rates. While we believe the primary reason for this is his more advanced playstyle, we would like to explore ways to make him a little more comfortable to play.\n\nBy adding grip options to Deimos' AK-74M, we're hoping to make the weapon slightly more viable for his more aggressive support playstyle. However, we will be monitoring this change carefully, as we want to make sure that focus remains on taking full advantage of his DeathMARKs and Vendetta.\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   AK-74: Added Vertical, Angled, and Horizontal grips.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## BARBED WIRE\n\nOur primary goal is to enhance the effectiveness of Barbed Wire while increasing the risk of not dealing with it on time.\n\nWe aim to make it more reliable for Defenders. It should no longer be an easily bypassed obstacle for Attackers. Instead of routinely passing through the Barbed Wire, we want it to serve as a last-resort option. Attackers should carefully consider their approach before attempting to cross. The Barbed Wire now inflicts 5hp damage per second to any Attacker moving through it. While this isn't a substantial amount, it should encourage Attackers to respect its presence. Importantly, the damage only occurs while the operator is actively moving within the wire. This means that they can still enter and hold an angle without taking damage.\n\nDefenders should now rely on their hearing to detect Attackers moving through the wire. The operator's vocal reaction upon receiving damage reinforces the urgency of the situation and makes it more reliable. This feedback loop ensures that Defenders can respond promptly.\n\nWhile we are not modifying the distribution of Barbed Wire among Defenders at this time, we will closely monitor its impact. If necessary, we may adjust loadouts in the future.\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Deals 5hp damage every 1 second when moving inside it.\n-   Wire stiffness increased.\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n* * * * *\n\n![[R6S] Y9S2 Designer's Notes - Rank_Distribution_PC](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3UAH8zYEQvmDMNfpEi2dGU/8d8e5c64fa6969b3b63c086e8c1fcee1/Y9S1_Rank_Distribution_PC.jpg)\n\n![[R6S] Y9S2 Designer's Notes - Rank_Distribution_Console.](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4yZrBz9wwA89IZEGJFL2pD/628ea3fb4b548126915e459c08f67444/Y9S1_Rank_Distribution_Console.jpg)\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2L0bFvjA80swkS4EvawujB/y9s2-designers-notes","date":"2024-05-27T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"50c0MbM9IoHbgjV8MeoiA3","title":"R6 Membership Brings Animated Skins & Full Battle Pass Access","abstract":"Rainbow Six Siege Membership is the ultimate Siege offer that delivers a drop of exclusive content every month and gives full access to the Premium Battle Pass.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7oiYlPgr0L9EiSYA3z3Hle/be69f62120afd7a1c54117036f621d6d/R6SIEGE_KeyArt_Membership.jpg","content":"Unlock the ultimate Rainbow Six Siege experience with the R6 Membership!

We're currently restructuring, growing, and allocating more resources to our Anti-Cheat team, ensuring that we can provide a secure future for Siege. As the team expands, we'll have more opportunities to reflect the benefits of this growing team in-game. While we're in this stage, our team remains focused on improving your experience.\n\n## BANS: DATA BANS + BATTLEYE\n\n### BAN NUMBERS\n\nHere we have our latest ban data, including bans for February, March, and April.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – MAY 2024 - BanChart](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1VO5c6wIwyxqgkEubx0ooN/965e2ac5c7521678f509e9f7c877b169/R6_BanChart_Nov-Apr24.jpg)\n\n### DATA BANS & ADDITIONAL DETECTIONS\n\nThis season marks a significant evolution in our approach to cheating, as we've made improvements to our Data Ban system moving to a machine learning model. We've vastly increased the number of data points used to analyze a player's performance, resulting in a __meaningful increase in cheaters being detected and sanctioned through this method__. We've also optimized our sanctioning process by increasing how often we run our sanctions, effectively __reducing the time it takes to ban detected cheaters by half using this model__.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, we also have new Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detections which are currently being used to sanction players. We know that this has been affecting players and we want to make it clear that we are working on identifying behaviors and sanctioning players who are taking advantage of these services.\n\nLooking ahead, we're working on an improved detection of AFK avoiders (idle botters) as well as additional cheat detection updates. These will further enhance our ability to identify and ban cheaters in Rainbow Six Siege, improving the experience for everyone.\n\n## ADDRESSED CHEATS & HARDENING\n\n### ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS\n\n__CHEATING INCREASE__\n\nAs we recently [communicated](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1785686962097005015), we are aware of the increase in cheating behaviors reported by the community. We want to reassure you that addressing these concerns is a top priority for our Anti-Cheat team and that we are looking to deploy solutions to resolve these issues as soon as possible. The Y9S1.3 patch deployed on May 2<sup>nd</sup> has temporarily improved this situation while we work on longer term solutions to prevent those cheats.\n\n__CRASH EXPLOIT__\n\nOur team is actively working on a fix for the Crash Exploit reported by the community. Until then, Abandon Penalties have been retroactively reduced to a 5-minute duration.  All newly issued Abandon Penalties will be 5 minutes as well. Thanks a lot for your reports!\n\n### ADDRESSED CHEATS\n\nSeveral cheats have been addressed since our last Anti-Cheat Status Update, with some updates going live with Y9S1.3. However, in recent months, we have seen a dramatic decrease in a number of rage cheats being used. This reflects the ongoing work that our team is doing in order to tackle new cheats and protect the game and its players.\n\n### HARDENING\n\nHardening is the act of increasing the security and reducing the surface of vulnerability of the game's code, to protect against attackers. In Y9S1.2, we made several changes which resulted in improved overall game security, and we'll have more improvements coming in Y9S2. These improvements are continuous, and our updates are playing a crucial role in making the game safer. We'll be sharing more on our hardening efforts in the future.\n\n## QB SYSTEM\n\nQB is a security system available on PC, designed to make cheat creation more tedious, difficult, and expensive. By creating a less effective environment for cheat creators, our aim is to reduce the amount of cheats being successfully created and sold.\n\n### UPDATE CADENCE & UX IMPROVEMENTS\n\nWe want to ensure that QB remains effective, so as promised, we are continuing to provide regular updates to this system, and these will come at an increased cadence compared to Year 8.\n\nAnother goal of ours is to share more information with legitimate players, helping to understand why a game restart may be happening. Some of these changes are already live; for instance, you may now see the \"Update available\" prompt in-game in some circumstances, asking you to restart the game when possible.\n\n## MOUSETRAP\n\n### CURRENT STATUS\n\nMouseTrap is a system designed to detect spoofing devices which enable the use of mouse and keyboard on consoles. Changes implemented in Y9S1 have broadened its detection capabilities, allowing us to find more suspicious players.\n\nThis season, we are also focusing on your feedback, with most changes being aimed towards enhancing our current system. The Y9S1.3 update is helping to further increase the accuracy of MouseTrap by expanding on the types of devices that it can recognize, and improving the detection of currently identifiable devices. As well as this, the update is working to further minimize false positives, resulting in fewer controller players being incorrectly detected.\n\n### MOUSETRAP PENALTIES & MATCHMAKING [TARGET: Y9S4]\n\nIn Y9S4, we'll be making use of MouseTrap's detection in new ways, directly improving the experience for controller players. In this upcoming Y9S4 update, if a player is detected using a spoofing device three times,the updated Crossplay system will __automatically place them into the PC matchmaking pool__ for a 90-day period. This will result in matches that feel fairer for controller players, while giving users of the spoofing devices a choice in how they want to play the game.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, our dedication to upholding the integrity and fairness of Rainbow Six Siege is unwavering. Our goal this year is to make Rainbow Six Siege both more secure and more reactive when it comes to cheating. Through a multifaceted approach, encompassing machine learning and Data Bans, rigorous hardening, and innovative detection systems such as QB and Mousetrap, we are continuously following up on our commitment to safeguarding the gaming experience for all players.\n\nCheaters have no place in Siege, our teams are committed to making Siege safe and enjoyable for everyone.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","anti-cheat","dev-blogs"],"readTime":6,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2V90gThNqHBtmzK4Bf6AhV/anticheat-status-update-may-2024","date":"2024-05-10T15:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"4Xwna9dWPwd3m4KUcGrHIp","title":"Y9S1 Mid-Season Roadmap Update","abstract":"See the upcoming features detailed in this mid-season roadmap update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4w3HMFvz9ZPOXFZs41XU7s/38693eb4c14d1e212d53f987b25c0915/Y9S1_Roadmap.jpg","content":"Each season, we provide a Roadmap update to offer further insights into the development of upcoming features to ensure transparent communication with all players.

This notion had to be introduced to reflect the implementation of the pick & ban.*\n\n*Presence definition: pick rate of an Operator when not banned.

However, despite this shift, their performance statistics do not raise any immediate concerns. Consequently, we have decided not to make any adjustments to the sights distribution in this patch.*\n\n*It's essential to recognize that the graphs presented reflect only a small segment of the Ranked player base. Below those ranks and across the broader player community, the presence of these operators is considerably lower.*\n\n*Their presence was higher at the beginning of the season and gradually declined to the numbers you see right now. This downward trend suggests that these operator choices are driven more by novelty than by overwhelming strength. We observed similar patterns during the 1,5x era, and based on tests conducted over the past year, we prefer a cautious approach rather than immediate reaction because the system is still too new. We believe maintaining the current distribution throughout the entire season won't compromise the overall balance.*\n\n*Additionally, prematurely removing these operators could prompt players to swiftly switch to the next operator equipped with Magnified Scope. Such a shift might adversely impact the balance of other operators that have not received as much attention and are currently in a good position. Hasty removal would not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate all the pros and cons of the new sights, especially considering that nostalgia and novelty are still influencing the decisions.*\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### AZAMI\n\n#### KIBA BARRIER\n\n- Increased by 10% the damage received by High caliber Handguns and Revolvers.\n  - Handguns: .44 Mag Semi-Auto, D-50\n  - Revolvers: .44 Vendetta, Keratos .357, LFP586\n- Increased by 10% the damage received by Medium caliber Submachine Guns and Assault Rifles.\n  - Submachine Guns: K1A, P90, UMP45, Vector.45 ACP\n  - Assault Rifles: 416-C Carbine, 552 Commando, 556XI, AK-12, AR33, AUG A2, C7E, C8-SFW, Commando 9, F2, F90, G36C, L85A2, PARA-308, POF-9, R4-C, SC3000K, Type-89\n- Increased by 5% the damage received by High caliber Assault Rifles and Light Machine Guns.\n  - Assault Rifles: AK-74M, ARX200, M4, M762, Mk17 CQB, Spear .308, V308\n  - Light Machine Guns: 6P41, ALDA 5.56, DP27, G8A1, LMG-E, M249, M249 SAW, T-95 LSW\n\nThe weapon base damage, the damage drop-off curve, the distance to the barrier, and the barrier resistance are just a few of the variables we need to consider for the +100 weapons available when balancing this system. We were already aware that the Kiba Barriers might still require too many bullets to be destroyed by certain weapons. However, we wanted to be cautious not to render the barriers completely ineffective now that every operator will be able to deal with them. As a result, we opted for an initial release with barriers that remain robust. Our plan is to iterate, seeking the optimal balance while closely monitoring the impact of each adjustment.\n\nDespite the data is showing that the new feature is being utilized, the lifespan of the barriers hasn't significantly changed. This suggests that Attackers continue to face challenges when dealing with them. Explosives and melee attacks remain the primary methods of destruction, making the risk associated with shooting at a barrier still high enough to favor the use of explosives.\n\nUpon analyzing the damage received by the barriers during destruction, we observed that Designated Marksman Rifles perform exceptionally well against them. Consequently, our focus will primarily be on increasing the damage received from Assault Rifles and Light Machine Guns. The additional weapons mentioned here are affected for the sake of consistency, as they share the same caliber configuration.\n\n### IANA\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary Gadgets: Added Impact EMP Grenade. Removed Stun Grenades.\n\nConsidering her ability to bait defenders and facilitate re-frag opportunities for teammates following the hologram, she should be an excellent operator choice for support players. Additionally, her infinite intel gathering resources make her particularly advantageous in the current situation, where drones are limited. Therefore, we will enhance her support capabilities by incorporating Impact EMP Grenades and maybe look into the Gemini Replicator in the future.\n\n### LESION\n\n#### GU MINE\n\n-   Initial damage: Reduced to 3hp (from 5).\n-   Gadget refill timer: Increased to 25 seconds (from 20).\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Secondary Gadgets: Added Observation Blocker. Removed Impact Grenades.\n\nSince the removal of cloaking from his GU Mines, we've observed positive changes in his performance. Despite the uncloaked mines, the number of mines triggered per round has remained relatively stable, resulting in higher average damage than initially anticipated.\n\nTo maintain the core essence of the GU Mine, we have made a slight reduction in its initial damage. Our intention is to emphasize the urgency of removing the mine and the fear associated with encountering another one. Rather than an immediate kill, we aim to create a strategic window of opportunity for players to engage with the enemy.\n\nLesion's increased resources allow him to exert significant map control very quickly and block attackers' access to the building from very early in the round. Consequently, we've extended the time required to acquire the mines. While this may reduce early-round map control, it ensures Lesion's continued impact in late-game scenarios. He remains a priority target for attackers.\n\nRegarding secondary gadgets, we believe that the GU Mines should be enough for slowing down Ballistic Shields and the Impact Grenades give him too much flexibility. So we are going to change them for the Observation Blocker, which also synergies well with its primary ability providing extra protection.\n\n### NOKK\n\n#### HEL PRESENCE REDUCTION\n\n-   Duration: Increased to 30 seconds (from 20).\n-   Cooldown: Increased to 30 seconds (from 20).\n\nThe recent changes to Frag Grenades, along with increased operator access, have had a negative impact on Nokk's presence.\n\nTo mitigate this issue while we investigate other solutions to make her more impactful, we will be increasing the duration of the HEL Presence Reduction. This adjustment will allow Nokk to traverse bigger areas more comfortably without being detected in defenders' cameras and catch them by surprise.\n\n### ORYX\n\n#### REMAH DASH\n\n-   Will destroy Deployable and Talon shields. The dash is not interrupted.\n\nWe are updating the Remah Dash to improve comfort and consistency. From now on, Deployable Shields and Talon Shields will no longer impede Oryx during the dash; instead, they will be destroyed and he will go through. This adjustment aligns with player expectations, especially considering Oryx's existing ability to pass through Kiba Barriers and Reinforced Barricades.\n\n### SENS\n\n#### R.O.U. PROJECTOR SYSTEM\n\n-   Max. Resources: Increase to 4 R.O.U. Projectors (from 3).\n\nDespite the numerous improvements to the POF-9 and the additional utility that brings, Sens continues to underperform. We acknowledge the intricacy and skill required to use the R.O.U. Projectors effectively. The unpredictability of bounces can sometime work against you. We hope the new Trajectory Previsualization can help to improve accuracy, but we are going to allocate additional resources to enhance flexibility and provide more opportunities for error correction while we keep investigating new ways to improve it.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## IMPACT GRENADE\n\n### EXPLOSION\n\n- Damage: Reduced to 40hp (from 60).\n- Radius: Reduced to 2 meters (from 3).\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Azami\n- Caveira\n- Clash\n- Echo\n- Goyo\n- Maestro\n- Melusi\n- Rook\n- Valkyrie\n- Vigil\n- Wamai\n\nWe recognize the growing significance of Impact Grenades over the years. They play a crucial role in site setup, facilitate defenders' swift rotations, aid in clearing attackers utility, deny walls, and even eliminate adversaries. However, we acknowledge their excessive versatility, which prompts us to address their killing potential and wall-denial capabilities.\n\nWe have implemented a reduction in damage. As a result, double-impacting an enemy will no longer result in an immediate kill. Also, opponents must be even more damaged to employ a grenade to secure the elimination.\n\nThe reduction in explosion radius will yield two key effects:\n\n1.  Impact-Tricking countermeasures: Attackers can prevent it by positioning the hard-breach device as close to the ground as possible in additional locations, And defender must be more accurate to do it successfully.\n2.  Precision requirement for utility clearance: Defenders must exercise greater accuracy when dealing with attackers' utility, such as Airjabs and Claymores. This adjustment allows attackers to place more reliance on this type of gadgets and experiment with unexpected placements.\n\nOur intention is to promote the use of the right tool in the right situation, rather than relying solely on something that can serve multiple purposes. Defenders have other tools at their disposal that can achieve these objectives more effectively. Our final goal is to enhance tactical gameplay and reward the correct decision-making in every match.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n## BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\n### GUARD BREAK\n\n-   Explosion: Trigger threshold reduced to 30 damage (from 50).\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blitz\n- Fuze\n- Montagne\n- Clash\n\nOur goal is to ensure that the Impact Grenades remain effective counters against Ballistic Shields. Because of the recent damage change, we find it necessary to adjust the threshold for breaking a shield owner's guard. \n\nThe guard break system relies on the damage received, and it's important to note that no other explosives have undergone alterations. Consequently, other explosive devices will now create larger openings than before.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2D4HsYOBEEg0wEW5dim34o/y9s13-designers-notes","date":"2024-04-30T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"3snO7ANe2VLZYitMeP2eqc","title":"Reputation System Beta: Status Update","abstract":"Reputation System Developments in Year 9.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6Sov86Js8p3e8gLeuVSXWQ/497134ec303da98abb9d350c59a26fab/RepSys.Y9S1.960x540.png","content":"In Y9S1 and beyond, we'll continue to update the Reputation System Beta to ensure its accuracy before any Standing Impacts go live.\n\nThis season, we've made several changes to the Reputation System. In this article, we'll share more on what these changes mean and how we plan to continue improving this system.\n\n## Y9S1 - POST LAUNCH LEARNING\n\nFollowing the Y9S1 release, it became clear that certain aspects of the Reputation System were not working as intended. Our teams gathered and analyzed player feedback while completing internal investigations, leading us to identify issues affecting the player experience.\n\n### COMMUNICATION PENALTIES - VOICE & WRITTEN\n\nWe found that players were receiving communication penalties at a higher rate than expected. In response to this, a decision was made to disable the voice chat and written chat penalties. These communication penalties will remain disabled until we can implement further levers to ensure that all penalties given are fair, while also providing players a clear path to improvement.\n\nOn consoles, we were made aware of another issue which led to increased voice chat reports being visible in the Reputation Center. We also found that in some cases, misconduct such as Griefing or Voice Abuse was incorrectly labeled as \"Excessive\" in the Reputation Centre. A fix was released addressing these on March 21<sup>st</sup>.\n\n### COMMENDATION EFFECTS\n\nAfter season launch, we became aware of an issue affecting the speed at which Commendations would be reflected in a player's Standing, resulting in lower Standings for many players. Commendations are now affecting Standings promptly and correctly.\n\n## Y9S1 - REPUTATION SYSTEM UPDATE\n\n### STANDING DEFINITIONS & BALANCING UPDATE\n\nWith the launch of Y9S1, we implemented our latest balancing update for the Reputation System. Here we used the built-in weights and levers to better define the attainment of each Standing, aligning more closely with our intentions. The five bracket Standings were also redefined to provide more meaning to each of them.\n\nThe aim behind system balancing is to ensure that your Standing mirrors your actions. Right now, many players will find themselves in the Respectable bracket. Being in Respectable is a great place to be and should be the aim; it means you're the core of the Siege community, you're not detracting from others' experiences, and you're playing with care, making Siege enjoyable for players around you. Some players with consistent positive behavior might also enter the Esteemed and Exemplary brackets, but maintaining these can be more challenging.\n\nLooking at the two lower brackets, falling into Disruptive doesn't necessarily mean your behavior is always negative, but it does indicate that you're not playing to the Siege ideals overall. With some effort, the Respectable Standing can be achieved. However, if a player finds themselves in Dishonorable, it means there are clear negative trends. In these cases, players need to adjust their behavior and remain consistent to improve their Standing and experience for the community's benefit.\n\n## WHAT'S NEXT?\n\n### MORE LEVERS, MORE CONFIDENCE\n\nWe've learned a lot since the Reputation System entered, in Y8S4, in its grace period and we're continuing to integrate those learnings to ensure that the Reputation System is fair, resilient, and understandable for all players.\n\nWe are currently making progress in incorporating protections that make a player's Standing more robust, going beyond reacting to player reports, and instead using additional factors. These improvements are directly driven by the feedback you have shared with us.\n\nOur work continues so that we can develop further levers that will enable us to reactivate the communication penalties. We want to ensure that our system applies penalties only where necessary, and that players have a full understanding and trust in the Reputation System.\n\n### STANDING IMPACTS & RELEASE STATUS\n\nThanks to your feedback, it's became clear that large changes are needed in order for the Reputation System to meet the requirements that we've set. With this in mind, Impacts based on your Standing will be no longer be introduced in Y9S2 and will instead come in a later season. Consequently, as the Reputation System will not see its full release in the coming season, it will remain in Beta for now.\n\nWe'll be sharing more information soon on when you can expect to see Impacts and the full release of the Reputation System. The deployment of Impacts will also be announced ahead of time so that players can be prepared. Once this feature does go live, we'll be monitoring the system closely and listening to your feedback on the update.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Reputation System will continue to retain its Beta status, reflecting its current form as we continue to make improvements and collect further feedback. Our priority will be to ensure that everyone is confident in the state of the Reputation System as we focus on reducing toxicity and making Siege a fun and enjoyable game for everyone.\n\nWe aim to continue to provide transparency and responsiveness around this system, and as we move forward, we want to keep hearing about your experiences.

Win Delta: The Win Delta is aggregated from Operator's Win Deltas per Bomb Site.*\n\n### OPERATOR BAN RATE\n\n![[R6S] Y9S1 Designer's Notes - R6S_DN_Y9S1_BanMatrix_Att](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2ilTWZhMFBWvR6jc5zfuyh/da7de1a97f300e3787d8f545ecf63781/R6S_DN_Y9S1_BanMatrix_Att.mp4)\n\n![[R6S] Y9S1 Designer's Notes - R6S_DN_Y9S1_BanMatrix_Def](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2ZjSZJm3NfwG1OgYvFxNmq/c9724782881f312090bd672ca5cfd9bf/R6S_DN_Y9S1_BanMatrix_Def.mp4)\n\n# OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### AZAMI\n\n#### KIBA BARRIER\n\n-   Barriers have 999hp.\n-   Barriers are vulnerable to bullet damage.\n-   The damage dealt to the barriers depends on the weapons' caliber or destruction output.\n\nAzami has reinvented the way to defend some sites and have made others viable or at least more comfortable for defenders. Her ability to reshape the map is something that has changed Siege forever. But in a lot of situations, her ability requires too much from attackers or creates unfair situations.\n\nThey can be placed in locations that are impossible to reach with melees or extremely risky to approach. Additionally, explosives as the only reliable way to counter them makes her very taxing for Attackers and limits their flexibility to pick operators with non-explosive utility. Repeatedly destroying placed barriers is tedious and frustrating for attackers, even more so if you have used explosives to deal with them.\n\nTo try and solve those problems, we tested several options that were later discarded:\n\n-   __Soft__: The idea was to allow bullets to go through the barrier. This turned the barriers into an indestructible soft wall, which was interesting, and fixed some nasty pixel peeks that are unchallengeable for attackers. It also mitigated the urgency to destroy them, therefore the resources required, as you could pre-fire through them to inhibit the defender from using them. But we considered that this took away too much of the Kiba Barrier's identity.\n\n-   __Lifespan__: In this prototype, the barriers would only last for a specific time and then they would auto-destroy. The main problem with this version was that Attackers didn't have any authority or a new way to deal with them besides waiting, and it wasn't a fun interaction.\n\nFinally, we decided that adding a new way to destroy them from a distance was the best approach, so the barriers keep their essence and Attackers have more options. Kiba Barriers will now be __vulnerable to bullets.__ They will take damage and get destroyed when their life is down to 0. As they are similar to walls, the damage received will be affected by the weapon caliber, so high caliber weapons, such as DMRs or LMGs, will destroy the barriers faster, while lower caliber weapons, such as Handguns or SMGs, will require more bullets. \n\nAll the other ways to destroy the barriers will remain the same, so a single explosion or 3 melee hits will also do the job. However, you can combine them, so hitting them twice and then shooting at them from a safer location is possible.\n\n### FINKA\n\n#### ADRENAL SURGE\n\n-   Weapon reload speed increase bonus removed.\n-   Clears the shields' Suppressive Fire debuff. Reduces its effect by 50% if applied while affected by Adrenal Surge.\n\nWe have removed the weapon reload bonus from the Adrenal Surge to make the bonus on the new Angled Grip more appealing. Without speeding-up the animations and with the possibility of both effects stacking, the new attachment wasn't as impactful as we wanted.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### WEAPON CLASSES\n\n#### GENERAL\n\n-   New classes: Revolver, Sniper Rifle, Slug Shotgun.\n\n#### LIGHT MACHINE GUNS\n\n-   Movement speed reduced by 10%.\n\n#### ADS TRANSITION\n\n-   Normalized and simplified ADS curve transitions:\n  -   Fast: Handguns, Revolvers, Shotguns.\n  -   Medium: Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles.\n  -   Slow: Machine Pistols, Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles, Light Machine Guns, Slug Shotguns.\n\n#### ADS SPEED\n\n-   Reduced ADS speed from idle/walk stances:\n  -   Handgun: 240ms (from 200).\n  -   Revolver: 240ms (from 200).\n  -   Machine Pistol: 380ms (from 280).\n  -   Submachine Gun: 460ms (from 300).\n  -   Assault Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Light Machine Gun: 560ms (from 450).\n  -   Marksman Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Sniper Rifle: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Shotgun: 340ms (from 250).\n  -   Slug Shotgun: 520ms (from 400).\n  -   Hand Cannon: 240ms (from 200).\n-   Reduced ADS speed from sprint (same proportion).\n-   Launchers are also affected. The ADS Speed depends on their type of sight.\n\nWith the goal of increasing players' options, weapon customization, and accessibility, we have taken a look at all the weapons in the game and normalized their configuration according to their class. We have cleared all the exceptions and strange mixes, such as the Commando 9 that was a mix of AR-SMG and is now 100% an AR, so everyone will know what to expect from a weapon just by checking its class but while the classes are new the gameplay hasn't changed.\n\nWe have also taken a deeper look at the LMG class. We nerfed them significantly last year to address the LMG-meta, but now we can bring them back. Along with tweaks to specific weapons that are listed below, we are going to add a movement penalty to the whole class to compensate for their magazine capacity.\n\nClearing all the fundamentals has allowed us to expand on the Weapon Attachments System by adding new attachments and new types of bonuses, as you will see below.\n\nThe current speed makes peeking a corner too advantageous, entering danger should be properly judged and have risks. Therefore, we have reduced the ADS speed across all weapons. The new timings aim to reduce the strength of fast-peeking and return some advantage to holding an angle or repositioning. Additionally, we have simplified what determines the precision from hip fire to aiming down sights, leaving only 3 typologies:\n\n-   Fast: Most of the precision is gained during the initial part of the transition (antilogarithmic). You can shoot with relatively good precision during the aiming animation.\n-   Medium: The precision is increased at a constant pace (linear).\n-   Slow: Most of the precision is gained during the final part of the transition (logarithmic). During the animation, it is more likely to still miss some shots on the target because it takes longer to transition from hip fire accuracy to ADS\n\n### SIGHTS\n\n#### IRON SIGHT\n\nCategory: No sight.\n-   Magnification: 1.0x.\n-   Added +10% ADS speed bonus.\n\n#### SIGHT\n\nCategory: Non-magnifying.\n-   Magnification: 1.0x.\n-   Added +5% ADS speed bonus.\n\n#### MAGNIFIED\n\nCategory: Magnifying.\n-   Magnification: ~2.5x.\n-   Attackers' distribution:\n  -   Available on every weapon.\n-   Defenders' distribution:\n  -   9mm C1: Frost.\n  -   P10 Roni: Mozzie.\n  -   9x19SVN: Tachanka.\n  -   ACS12: Alibi, Maestro, Azami.\n  -   AR-15.50: Tubarao.\n  -   BOSG.12.2: Vigil.\n  -   Mk 14 ERB: Aruni.\n  -   MP5K: Wamai.\n  -   MP5: Doc, Melusi, Rook.\n  -   P90: Doc, Rook.\n  -   TCSG12: Goyo, Kaid.\n  -   UMP45: Castle.\n  -   UZK50GI: Thorn.\n  -   Vector .45 ACP: Goyo.\n\n#### TELESCOPIC\n\nCategory: Magnifying.\n-   Magnification: ~3.5x.\n-   Available only on Attacking DMRs.\n\n#### RETICLES\n\n-   Increased middle dot size:\n  -   Holo A.\n  -   Holo C.\n  -   Red Dot C.\n  -   Magnified A.\n-   Reduced middle dot size:\n  -   Holo B.\n  -   Magnified C.\n\nA few years ago, using the sight with the highest magnification was the way to go, now the 1.5x is the default. We want sight selection to be an important decision based on your strategy for the round. So, we have reworked the entire attachment category.\n\nFirst off, we have made an existing option more meaningful. The \"None\" sight option is now Iron Sight and has a category, No Sight. You will aim faster if you choose Iron Sights, its shape will depend on the weapon, so there is a wide variety of options to explore and test if they fit your play style.\n\nSecondly, we have the Non-Magnifying category, which includes all the attachable sights without magnification. This is a category you already know and is where you can find the Red Dot, Holographic, and Reflex sights. This category will also have an ability, and similarly No Sight, they will increase your ADS speed but with a lower percentage as they are generally more comfortable to use. We have also detected a couple of reticles that were slightly better than the rest, so we have re-balanced them.\n\nFinally, we have reorganized all the Magnifying scopes. There are fewer magnifications, making the choice and differences between each one more meaningful. We have kept only two, now called Magnified and Telescopic. For each scope type, you will have a few options to choose depending on which one is more comfortable for you. We have also tweaked the Magnified A and C reticles, so the options are balanced.\n\nThe Magnifying scopes' distribution has also changed. We believe that now every sight has its pros and cons, so we can be less restrictive with their distribution:\n\n-   The Magnified will be available on every Assault Rifle, Submachine Gun, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Rifle, and Slug Shotgun in Attack.\n-   The Magnified will be available on every Slug Shotgun, Marksman Rifle, and in some designated Submachine Gun in Defense (listed above).\n-   The Telescopic will be available on every Marksman Rifle in Attack.\n\nAll the changes listed here, will create a lot of possibilities and many new scenarios. This is a new beginning for the weapon attachments system. We are happy with the current proposal, but we will monitor everything closely and continue making adjustments if needed in future patches.\n\n### UNDER BARRELS\n\n#### LASER\n\n-   Removed Hip Fire bonus.\n-   Added +10% ADS speed bonus.\n\nThe Laser bonus has changed to ADS speed.\n\nNow that we are tweaking the ADS speed across all the weapons, we didn't want to have this bonus limited to only those with access to grips. The laser has been available on almost every weapon since Y6S3.0, so everyone can use it and benefit from its ability.\n\nAdditionally, the Laser has the downside of revealing your presence, so it made sense to pair it with one of the most aggressive bonuses.\n\n### GRIPS\n\n#### ANGLED GRIP\n\n-   Removed ADS speed bonus.\n-   Added +20% weapon reload speed.\n\n#### HORIZONTAL GRIP\n\n-   The \"None\" option is now called \"Horizontal Grip\".\n-   Added +5% movement speed bonus.\n\n#### VERTICAL GRIP\n\n-   Bonus reduced to +20% vertical recoil control (from +25%).\n\nWe have added a new option, the Horizontal Grip. Just as with the Iron Sight, it is a rework of the \"None\" grip option into a viable and meaningful choice. It will grant you extra mobility. Bear in mind that we are not making any operator move faster than they currently can, this attachment only allows you to move at the \"handgun\" speed but with your primary weapon, at the cost of sacrificing the other grip bonuses. \n\nThe Angled Grip has also been reworked, and now grants Weapon Reload speed, an exciting bonus for those weapons that need to reload often or have long animations.\n\nSilencers and Extended Barrels have been more popular since their respective reworks, so we have also reduced the recoil control bonus of the Vertical Grip, making equipping them a tougher decision.\n\nOnly weapons with access to the Grips section can make use of these options. By default, they are unavailable, and you must equip the attachment to get the ability. As an example, the MP5K doesn't have the Vertical Grip bonus, and the F2 doesn't have the Horizontal Grip bonus.\n\n### BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\n#### BASE\n\nMovement:\n- Every operator equipped with a Ballistic Shield will keep it in front while sprinting.\n- An operator equipped with a Ballistic Shield can push through a barricade without having to hit them twice. Does not work from rappel.\n\nWeapon handling:\n- The ability to hip fire has been removed.\n- Reduced accuracy during the shield unequip animation.\n- During the ADS animation with a shield, the weapon will not shoot until it is pointing forward.\n- Reduced ADS time to 0.5 seconds walking and 0.55 seconds sprinting (from 0.6 both).\n- The reload animation is performed behind the shield.\n- The reload will now be triggered automatically when the weapon runs out of bullets.\n\nMelee:\n- New defensive melee animation.\n- The melee now deals pushback and 65hp damage (from 100% DBNO).\n-   New gadget throw animation from behind the shield (the animation will arrive in a later update).\n-   New gadget trigger animation from behind the shield.\n-   The Ballistic Shield remains equipped while escorting the Hostage.\n-   Touching fire will trigger the guard break with 40% intensity (same as electricity).\n\n#### FREE LOOK\n\n*Please note: The \"Freelook Throw\" animation has been disabled temporarily and will be fixed in a later update.  *\n\n-   Can hold the FREE LOOK button to check your surroundings while keeping the Ballistic Shield aiming forward.\n-   Can throw gadgets towards the direction you are looking.\n\n#### SUPPRESSIVE FIRE\n\n-   The operator will be suppressed if the Ballistic Shield receives too many bullet impacts.\n  -   Trigger: 10 bullets.\n  -   Maximum intensity: 40 bullets.\n  -   Fall off: 7 seconds.\n-   While suppressed, the operator cannot sprint. \n-   While suppressed, the visibility is reduced according to the effect's intensity. \n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Blitz\n-   Fuze\n-   Montagne\n-   Clash (only suppressive fire)\n\nWe have reimagined the mechanics around the ballistic shields in the game. Focusing on the shield being safer to use and support orientated at range as well as more threatening in close quarters. This will allow shield ops to take ground, provide more intel and control combat engagements with greater efficiency.  \n\nThis update also helps realign our ballistic shields to follow two core Siege design principles: \n\n1) To be lethal with a gun, you need to be vulnerable.    \n2) Actions from Player's direct input are not to be randomized. They are to be deliberate, consistent and reliable.\n\nRemoving the hip fire feature from the ballistic shields serves these principles.\n\nLike all other weapons and equipment, it is our goal to make sure every item in our operator's armories has a role and is viable when deployed with creative strategies and teamplay. We will be monitoring these changes and bringing more updates to our shields in the future.\n\n### LMG-E\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Ram\n-   Zofia\n\nThe LMG-E's recoil is one of the hardest to control in R6, especially if the player tries to empty its magazine without releasing the trigger. We've seen how this weapon's popularity and performance has decreased during the last few seasons, and that is why we want to make the recoil less challenging for players. The new Movement Speed Reduction for the LMG Class allows us to employ meaningful changes. That said, due to its huge magazine and high rate of fire, the LMG-E recoil will still be one of the hardest to control within the LMG Class.\n\n### 6P41\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Finka\n-   Fuze\n\nThe 6P41 was one of the highest performance weapons in the game during Y7, due to the combination of great fire power and a strong operator like Finka behind it. In the last few years, we've released several changes that have made the weapon one of the hardest to control which consequently makes it perform below average. The addition of the Movement Speed Reduction for LMGs allows us to restore some of its former glory by setting an easier to control recoil, this should make this weapon a more balanced and appealing option for players.\n\n### M249\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Capitao\n-   Attacker Recruit\n\nCapitao's M249 has maintained very similar performance when compared with its loadout alternative the PARA-308, but its popularity has been way lower. The inclusion of the new Movement Speed Reduction paired with updated recoil should make it easier to control, this change aims to increase the popularity of the M249, which should invite Capitao players to spend more time with his LMG.\n\n### M249 SAW\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced first kick.\n-   Reduced lateral recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Gridlock\n\nGridlock's LMG is currently in a good spot in terms of performance and pick rate when compared to its alternative the F90. The new LMG Class Movement Speed reduction could disrupt this loadout equilibrium, to avoid this we are making the M249 SAW recoil easier to control.\n\n### G8A1\n\n#### WEAPON RECOIL\n\nPC & Console\n-   Reduced vertical recoil.\n-   The recoil will remain stable for longer during a sustained fire burst.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Amaru\n-   IQ\n\nThe G8A1 is the most picked and best performing weapon in Amaru's loadout but it has remained as an under performing and under picked weapon for IQ for a long time.\n\nThe inclusion of the Speed Reduction for LMGs gives us more space to make the G8A1 recoil a little easier to control, this should ensure that this weapon retains and potentially improves its performance and appeal to players.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":18,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3jBlCdtRBQx2sCjmY2umNu/y9s1-designers-notes","date":"2024-02-26T10:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"427BHmfNfGsFcHrBxLu1D5","title":"“I was there when Rainbow began.

He is a force to be reckoned with. DEIMOS is an attack Operator who was there when Rainbow began and wishes to see its downfall.\n\nCommitted and austere, this Operator runs by the book and is a true soldier at heart. His main mission in life is simple: to create the greatest soldiers the world has ever seen. DEIMOS is making his debut in the new season Operation DEADLY OMEN because a match against him is just that.\n\nDEIMOS is a tracking Operator who uses his DeathMARK, to reveal his opponents' locations while also revealing his own. The DeathMARK makes both players aware of each other's position until time runs out or one player has met their demise.  DeathMARK and DEIMOS are a match made in heaven or hell depending on where you stand, both unrelenting as they force confrontation. His 44 Vendetta is his only weapon compatible to use concurrently with DeathMARK and is great for when he needs to get the job done.\n\nDeathMARK isn't his only tool of termination, he can take out opponents with his AK-74M or M590A1. With 2 HEALTH and 2 SPEED DEIMOS is for players who love to strategize and want to outsmart their prey. His collection of weapons also makes him a great choice for Front-Line players, with confidence and the gun skills to back it up. If you're playing against DEIMOS, you must rise to the challenge or be eliminated.\n\nA considerable opponent and soldier to his core DEIMOS will force Defenders to play by his rules. If you have what it takes to counter him; TUBARÃO or VIGIL will make for an interesting match. TUBARÃO's ZOTO CANNISTER can deactivate the DeathMARK temporarily; however, in doing so they will limit utility and movement. VIGIL, on the other hand, is better equipped to counter DEIMOS as he can use the ERC-7 to counteract the DeathMARK. No matter who you may choose to go against this aggressive Operator, DEIMOS and his DeathMARK are here to prove that you can run, but you certainly can't hide.\n\nStrike fear into the hearts of Defenders when you play DEIMOS, available on the Test Server starting on February 26, 2024.\n\n\"Bring DEIMOS on an operation?

It is clear that __the landscape of cheating in Siege is evolving__. For example, the QB System on PC is directly impacting cheat creation by making new cheats more difficult to create. It has been extremely successful in shaking up the cheating ecosystem with some cheat providers leaving or shutting down. However, new solutions and additional security measures can often act as double-edged swords; we deter less experienced cheat makers, but those that are well implanted will work harder to release new functional and undetectable cheats. This is why fighting cheats is a continuous endeavor.\n\nWe've now made a concentrated push to guarantee the necessary resources that Siege needs, and as part of this, we have created a special task force. We call this task force our Strike Team, supporting Player Protection with anti-cheat and security in Siege. This strike team has brought experts from multiple fields together in order to accelerate our ability to fine tune our anti-cheat solutions and target the most prolific cheats head-on.\n\n### PREVENTING CHEAT FEATURES AND EXPLOITS\n\nWe know that there are undetected cheats and gameplay exploits currently live in the game which are leading to a deteriorated gameplay experience. This is why we've implemented a strike team to tackle some of the most problematic cheats and exploits currently working in the game. It's crucial however that we not only react to cheats but also work to make cheat creation more difficult, and to this end our strike team has also been working on adding further encryptions throughout the game.\n\n### CHEATS ADDRESSED\n\nWe've addressed a number of cheats over the recent months with updates going live with Y8S4.3.\n\n__ADDRESSED CHEATS & EXPLOITS__\n\n- Various navigation cheats.\n- Various shooting-related cheats.\n- Various griefing cheats.\n- Various drone-related cheats.\n\nAs well as this, we've identified a prevalent cheat provider which led to a large ban wave and contributed to over 9,000 cheaters banned in January 2024, and 10,000 bans within a rolling 30-day period.\n\n## ANTI-CHEAT & BAN SYSTEMS\n\nLet's take a look at some of our anti-cheat and security systems, how they're working for us now, and what we're doing moving forward.\n\nTo start with, we want to assure you that our __anti-cheat solutions are always active__ and are only ever temporarily disabled to resolve issues which could affect our ability to protect legitimate players. Once resolved the affected system is then [reactivated](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1603102530678173696).\n\nWe do not deactivate our security or anti-cheat measures such as the QB System or MouseTrap for any prolonged amount of time, with BattlEye always remaining active.\n\n### MOUSETRAP\n\n__WORKAROUNDS__\n\nIn Year 8, we fixed a number of workarounds that were enabling spoofers to avoid or reduce their chances of detection, though we are aware that some players are still able to avoid the full effects of our system. We are working hard to counter these remaining workarounds and we are confident that you'll see further reductions in spoofing soon.\n\n__EFFECTIVENESS__\n\nMouseTrap continues to find, track, and penalize players who use mouse and keyboard on console through the use of spoofing devices and has remained active and effective throughout Year 8. The usage of spoofing devices which saw a drop on the release of MouseTrap has continued to trend at this lower rate since its release. Our data also shows that players do swap to controller if viable MouseTrap workarounds are not available, making a better experience for everyone.\n\n__MOUSETRAP UPDATES__\n\nWe are currently investigating new solutions to detect more types of spoofing adapters, and we've recently pushed an update to MouseTrap to further increase its effectiveness while ramping up its effects.\n\nIn this update we have:\n\n- Optimized our detection thresholds to identify more mouse and keyboard players on console.\n- Fined-tuned maximum latency penalties setting for the remainder of the season.\n\nThese changes will allow MouseTrap to detect even more players who are using mouse and keyboard on console, while adding high latency sooner.\n\nAs well as this, we are currently implementing additional in-game warning feedback for detected players and are developing an additional MouseTrap feature which will help to further level out the playing field. This feature will have a further positive impact on the match-to-match experience of console players. We will share more information on this important update during the Six Invitational.\n\n### QB SYSTEM\n\nAt its core, the purpose of the QB System is to make cheat creation more tedious, difficult, and costly, creating an unfavorable environment for cheat creators and sellers. QB is also beneficial when it comes to bans, having the ability to detect those who attempt to bypass it. We've already seen cheat creators giving up on Siege due to the increased effort that is now required for basic cheat development. It's made waves in the cheat market while having a great impact on Siege.\n\nAfter the successful launch of the QB System however, it became clear that we did not have the right long-term support in place that was required to ensure the system's continued effectiveness. We've now changed our approach and have committed to regular updates for the QB System going forward.\n\nWe are now developing new iterations which will be coming in Year 9, and in the meantime, we continue to fine-tune and further strengthen this innovative security system. QB is a solid system for Siege, and we're making sure that it's receiving the resources needed in order to maximize its performance.\n\nWe're excited to share more information on our advancements with the QB System later this year.\n\n### BANS - DATA BANS + BATTLEYE\n\n__BANS NUMBERS__\n\nHere we have our latest ban data, covering the last 3 months. We can see that while we had over 9,000 bans in January, the previous month of December was less successful in terms of detections and bans. This was due to new blatant cheats becoming available, most of which were not detectable during December, resulting in fewer bans and increased frustration for players. With our team focused on the cheats that are being used right now, we aim to see similar results to January in the near future.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – FEBRUARY 2024 - bans](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3rEwpPLQVxdZrvCz1LWQh5/5cf11d6ebfc3a9e192233dc2dfe04832/R6_BanChart_Nov-Jan24.jpg)\n\n__DATA BANS__\n\nSince their introduction, Data Bans have been a great success for Siege, finding illegitimate players that weren't already being found by our systems working at the forefront. However, __we fully recognize that there is room for improvement, with some high stat cheaters remaining undetected.__\n\nOur goal with Data Bans is to ensure that we can find as many cheaters as possible while continuing to protect our honest players. At the moment, we are working to __refine our data models__ by making use of additional player data points. This process will result in a more granular player overview, allowing us to increase the precision of the underlying system and in return boost its potency. As we continue to optimize we'll be able to adjust our thresholds, casting a wider net with full confidence, and finding and banning more cheaters that may have been going undetected.\n\nThere's more to come on Data Bans. We're also currently __developing a machine learning solution__ which will aim to broaden our ability to detect cheaters in Siege.\n\nWe'll be sharing more on this in a future update.\n\n__BATTLEYE__\n\nBattlEye is the system that makes up for most of our cheater bans. Like our other forms of anti-cheat, __BattlEye is never turned off__, remaining active at all times, finding and banning thousands of cheaters each month.\n\nAs some of you may have noticed, in-game mentions of BattlEye have been removed. This change is to make sure that cheaters aren't getting information on how or what they were detected by; even minor details such as the mention of a ban system can play a role in the creation of new and undetectable cheats. This small change will help in reducing the chances of our anti-cheat systems being bypassed by cheaters and cheat makers.\n\n![[R6S] ANTI-CHEAT STATUS UPDATE – FEBRUARY 2024 - 2023 bans](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2rFmB5Wxj9DS0krqeLmYRV/0363386ef47f7c03afe564477c0fd9f6/100k.Bans.960x540.png)\n\n## CONCLUDING OUR PLANS & VISION\n\nWe know that cheaters have a big impact on Siege and everyone's enjoyment of the game, which is why we're boosting our anti-cheat resources.

Blowtorch.\n-   Electrical Insulation effect extended by 1.5 seconds after Canister destruction. \n\nWe've seen how Tubarão's Zoto Canisters can be used with great success during his time on the live server. Although we're still monitoring his position within the meta as the season progresses and players learn to play and counter play him, we did want to quickly readjust an aspect of his ability following feedback we've received. Reducing the amount Zoto Canisters to 3 will mean players will need to use them more strategically throughout the round. The freezing effect will no longer cause any delay to Maverick's D.I.Y. blowtorch to better position him as a counter to Tubarão. The powerful synergy between Tubarão and Ops like Bandit, or Kaid is something we strongly believe in as it's an integral part of what makes Siege and its operators so interesting. That being said, we did observe that in his current state, those synergies left little room for counter play from attackers. The electrical insulation on metal objects affected by the Zoto Canisters previously lasted only as long as the Canister was active on a surface. The added 1.5 seconds of electrical insulation allow attacking teams with strong coordination a chance to respond and forces the defense to be much more precise in the execution of their strategy if they want to succeed in denying the breach.\n\n### ACE\n\n#### S.E.L.M.A. AQUA BREACHER\n\n-   Fuse time: Increase to 4 seconds (from 3.2)\n\nAce doesn't have many downsides. The S.E.L.M.A. is safe to use, quick to explode, fast to use in succession, opens a relatively big hole, and can destroy bulletproof utility. Its main downside is that it can be destroyed during the breaching process to prevent it from creating a navigable hole. But when compared with the downsides of other Hard Breach Operators, this is clearly not enough:\n\n-   Thermite: Only 1 at a time, must be close to the wall, is exposed while using the charge, but creates a bigger hole.\n-   Hibana: Slow deployment, slow triggering, but can be used from very far and has a lot of flexibility.\n-   Maverick: Requires quite a bit of time, must be close to the wall, is incredibly exposed while using it, but he doesn't have counters.\n\nBy increasing the fuse time, we want to give defenders a better chance to prevent the breach when a lot of resources are dedicated to protecting the wall. The extra time will increase the synchronization required between the breacher enabler (Thatcher, Impact EMP, etc.) and Ace to open an actively defended wall successfully.\n\n### KAPKAN\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Bulletproof Camera.\n-   Removed Impact Grenades.\n\nKapkan has a huge impact on every round regardless of the number of traps triggered. The way attackers must approach the map changes after spotting him or triggering one of his traps. They have to slow down and start paying attention to every window and door frame to ensure they won't blow up. The last buff to the EDDs made this psychological effect even stronger because you may not get a second chance.\n\nWe considered that he already has enough tools to make attackers lose time and the Impact Grenades are helping him be more elusive, allowing him to create rotations on the fly and make attackers invest even more time hunting him through a minefield.\n\n### MAVERICK\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Smoke Grenades.\n\nWe are aware that Maverick is a bit situational without Frag Grenades, and despite not having hard counters, there are not too many situations that justify bringing him over other Hard Breachers and an EMP source. It is dangerous to rely on him as the main breacher because of the time and danger he is in while doing the job. And as a secondary breacher, someone more flexible, such as Ace or Hibana (even the Hard Breach Charge), is usually a less limiting choice for the team.\n\nWe hope that the Smoke Grenades can help him be more appealing as a secondary breacher and increase his flexibility, so he can also help with site execution, or even cover himself while breaching through reinforcements.\n\n### THUNDERBIRD\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n-   Added Deployable Shield.\n\nWe finished her transition to a more supportive role with the latest tweaks to the Kona Station and loadout changes back in S2.0 but it seems like her utility is not appealing enough.\n\nThe addition of the Deployable Shield will allow her to create genuine strongholds for defenders by herself. The protection from the shield and the backup from the Kona Stations can make any defender in these positions a hard target to deal with. You can add a few Active Defense Systems or Mag-Net Systems to prevent the shield from getting destroyed too easily and attackers will have a tough time trying to move you out of position.\n\nAdditionally, the SPAS-15 is also improved to encourage her to contribute to site setup.\n\nWe believe that these changes can make her more appealing to players who like to experiment with different setups and help their teammates from the backline.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n* * * * *\n\n### SPAS-15\n\n#### RECOIL (PC & Console)\n\n-   First shot kick reduced.\n-   Lateral recoil increased.\n-   Elastic time increased.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Caveira\n-   Thunderbird\n\nAutomatic Shotguns were left on the sidelines during the Shotgun rework. We were aware that some of the changes introduced could be a bit scary at first sight, so we wanted to be sure that we didn't enter a new Shotgun meta era by buffing the automatic ones too much.\n\nDespite this, we don't have plans to touch them again in the near future (we want to see how everything settles), As we wanted to buff Thunderbird, we found it a good opportunity to make a slight tweak to the SPAS-15. Depending on the effect of these changes, we might give similar treatment to the other automatic shotguns.\n\nWe are reducing the first shot kick, which eases landing consecutive shots on the target and taking full advantage of the automatic mode. On the other hand, we are increasing the lateral recoil and adding a clear tendency to the left, which also reduces its tendency upwards.\n\n### G36C\n\n#### RECOIL (PC & Console)\n\n-   Vertical recoil increased.\n-   Horizontal recoil increased.\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Ash\n-   Iana\n\nBoth the R4C and ARX-200 have received balancing changes to reduce their power level in the last few years, this has made players gravitate towards the G36C. That combined with Ash and Iana being two of the strongest fraggers on Attack have made the G36C the weapon with the highest Kill Death Ratio on Attack. This alone isn't an issue; it is a strong weapon in the hands of Operators dedicated to \"kills\", but the difference between this weapon and other high KDR weapons in the game is too high. Access to the 1.5x sight is an element that strongly affects this weapon's power level, but also differentiates it from its Loadout competitors the R4-C and ARX-200.\n\nWith all of that in mind we've decided to modify its recoil. It will be harder to control on every axis which will require players to use more \"recoil control\" attachments and increase the difficulty of long-range engagements while using the 1.5x.\n\n### SMG-11\n\n#### BASE STATS\n\n-   Damage: Reduced to 32hp (from 35).\n\n#### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n-   Amaru\n-   Mute\n-   Smoke\n-   Solis\n\nFor a very long time, the SMG-11 has been the weapon with the lowest Time to Kill among all automatic weapons by far. The change in damage will put it more in line with all the other weapons, while remaining among the fastest. The change will increase the bullets required to kill 1-armor operators by 1, rewarding precision and punishing spraying and praying. \n\nWe could have reduced the damage even more without affecting the TTKs, but we want it to remain appealing enough to pair with primary shotguns.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":9,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1VJt41BV7BPIuQURfavThd/y8s42-designers-notes","date":"2024-01-22T20:39:00.000Z"},{"id":"6uMSX3GcrTsISxlA5CMmY","title":"Holiday Pack 2023","abstract":"Happy Holidays from the Rainbow Six Siege team!

Here we'll be covering what the full release means for players, how it will continue to improve, and the actions we've recently taken to further protect players.\n\n## PHILOSOPHY & GOAL\n\nWith the Reputation System, we are staying true to our core pillars:\n\n- __MITIGATE & DETER BEHAVIOR__\n- __PREVENT & ADDRESS__\n- __FEEDBACK & GUIDANCE__\n\nFollowing our core principles, we aim to shield our players against toxicity, curb in-game disruptions and negative behavior, encourage \"pro-social\" behavior, reform or remove toxic players, and more, while ultimately reinforcing the cooperative nature of Siege.\n\nOur guiding philosophy with the Reputation System itself is that each player should know why they have a particular Reputation Standing, what they can do to modify their playstyle or interactions and improve their position in the Reputation System. We want to ensure that players have the proper tools available to them and the opportunities to make any necessary adjustments. This release of the Reputation System marks an essential step for us, and with player feedback being a crucial part of our strategy, we will be listening to your thoughts and concerns.\n\n## SEASON 4 - WHAT'S NEW?\n\n### REVEAL RECAP\n\nBefore we delve into the latest Reputation System update, if you didn't see our Operation Deep Freeze reveal panel, we've got a recap covering what's been added in Y8S4 and what to expect in the future.\n\n<https://youtu.be/f2hqIkZSYe8>\n\n### GRACE PERIOD\n\nThe Reputation System has been released with updated features and UI, and an ongoing grace period. This grace period means that __there will currently be no impact__ based on a player's Reputation Standing alone, giving players an opportunity to become accustomed to the updated system and to adjust any behaviors before the impacts go live. In the meantime, we will be monitoring the system, collecting feedback, and performing calibrations, ensuring the Reputation System is ready before the grace period is lifted. Note however, that __this grace period does not affect currently implemented penalties__ such as communication penalties and reverse friendly fire that are already live.\n\n### REPUTATION CENTER UPDATE\n\nWe've updated the Reputation Center to bring even more information to players. Now you'll be able to see your biggest opportunities for improvement, the impacts that your Reputation Standing could have (after the grace period), and more.\n\nTwo new sections in the updated Reputation Center are Tips and Guides. Here we're sharing tips that can help players to improve their Reputation Standing and on their way to becoming great Siege community members and players.\n\n![[R6S] Reputation System: Activation & More - Rep Center](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6CQEEMlCxuyvo8I9iygZnq/0190ec1686afb0e49d2e944c9fd5c514/RepCenter.960x540.png)\n\nWith this release you'll start to see notifications with information about changes to your Reputation Standing. Players will be notified of Reputation Standing adjustments, as well as any possible effects current behavior could have on their Reputation Standing in the future. As part of these notifications, we'll also share the impacts that a player could face once the grace period has come to a close.\n\n![[R6S] Reputation System: Activation & More - notification](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4OTB9eWIFtsoERDNsHUTQY/bd5cfee06e029cc07b7b1bb6734a0361/Notifications.960x540.png)\n\n### NEW IMPACTS\n\nOnce the grace period has ended, there will be a range of positive and negative impacts depending on a player's Reputation Standing. We will share further updates in the future regarding when the grace period will end.\n\nHaving positive and good behaviour could bring:\n\n- Improved Renown gain.\n- Increased experience points.\n- Bonus Alpha Pack progress.\n- Unique rewards.\n\nAlternatively, negative and unwanted behavior could lead to:\n\n- Reduced experience and rewards.\n- Ranked rewards locks.\n- Playlist locks.\n\nThese negative impacts have been specifically chosen to help players to rehabilitate and adapt their behaviors in order to have those effects reversed or removed later in their journey.\n\n__PLAYLIST & RANKED REWARDS LOCKS - \\[NOT ACTIVE DURING CURRENT GRACE PERIOD\\]__\n\nPlayers who find their playlists restricted will need to increase their Reputation Standing in order to make them available once more. This means that players who have the lock enabled will actively need to change their behaviors in the remaining game modes, resulting in those good behaviors being reinforced.\n\nThe Ranked rewards lock will behave similarly to the playlist lock, and those who receive a lock on the upcoming Ranked rewards will also have opportunities to rectify the situation. In the following season players who increase their Reputation Standing to Respectable, will have their previous rewards granted.\n\n## PROTECTING PLAYERS AND CREATORS FROM REPORT ABUSERS\n\nIn-game reporting is incredibly helpful to our Player Protection team. Your in-game reports help to make our automatic detection more robust; they assist in investigations carried out by our Player Protection team, and aid in creating a safer playspace for everyone.\n\nWe do also want to reiterate to players that while in-game reporting continues to be an invaluable tool for our Player Protection team to leverage, __players will not be sanctioned based on in-game reports alone.__\n\nWe want players to know they can make use of the in-game reporting system, though we know that there are others looking to misuse these reporting tools as a method of abuse. Following your feedback, we've updated our system to better account for and to prevent report spamming. Critically however, players with poor behavior will still be able to be reported correctly, resulting in possible Reputation Penalties or game sanctions. In the future, we will continue to strengthen our validations while building upon and creating new safeguards, further increasing the robustness of our systems.\n\n## REPUTATION STANDING ACCURACY\n\nCurrently, the Reputation System already takes advantage of a whole host of positive and negative stats including in-game reports, Commendations, Reverse Friendly Fire, abandon abuse, and more, with the use of safeguarding logic. While these have given us enough data overall to provide a fair representation of a player's behavior, we know that we can further increase precision with additional data points covering other common player behaviors. To this end, we're working on including more granular data to define a player's Reputation with even more accuracy.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe new improvements we are introducing this season should greatly reduce occurrences of players finding undeserved reports on their Misconduct page, while also stopping illegitimate Reputation Penalties in worst case scenarios. If you continue to experience any issue with the Reputation System after this update, please report it via [R6Fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/).\n\nYou should expect to see additional adjustments and communications in the months to come around balancing, additional actions and protections, and Reputation Standing impacts, as we work to create a system that works best for everyone. We are always listening to your feedback and working on improvements to better reflect our goals; we want to make sure we're achieving the right results by rewarding positive and reputable players, while helping other players to improve their behavior.\n\nAs we continue into Y8S4 Operation Deep Freeze, keep in mind that the Reputation System will remain in a grace period. During that time, you'll get to see the impact of your in-game actions in the Reputation Center __without having the effects applied__. None of the impacts highlighted in the Reputation Center will be activated until this system is fully balanced and officially released, however, Reputation Penalties which are already live such as voice or written chat Penalties will continue to work as usual.\n\nWe want Siege to not only be a game of competitiveness and strategy, but also of joy and comfort. The Reputation System forms an essential component of our strategy to protect players, and we remain dedicated to our mandate of creating a welcoming environment for all.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","toxicity","dev-blogs"],"readTime":7,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/22JLMFeayzuamhb7YKbAjm/reputation-system-activation-more","date":"2023-12-18T14:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"74jMoilp5AghJCQpjcEoE2","title":"Y8S4.1 Patch Notes","abstract":"See the upcoming changes to Rainbow Six Siege with the release of Y8S4.1!","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/37gOBvZUlC6XMwThNj0rA9/63b3e2fe2c48688479d63841cd902bfe/Y8S4.1_PatchNotes.960x540.jpg","content":"You can find here the updates and fixes for the Y8S4.1 patch.\n\n## Y8S4.1 Patch Size\n\nFind the download sizes for each platform below.\n\n- Ubisoft Connect: 1.36 GB\n- Steam:  0.6 GB\n- Xbox One: 0.9 GB\n- Xbox Series X: 1.2 GB\n- PlayStation 4: 1.96 GB\n- PlayStation 5: 1.24 GB\n\n# BUG FIXES\n\n## GAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED -

In this blog, we'll shed some light on connectivity in 2023, look at what we've achieved, analyze any unplanned downtime, and take a peek at what the Connectivity team is working on.\n\n## A YEAR IN REVIEW\n\nFirstly, let's take a closer look at some of the changes brought to the game over the past year that had directly impacted Connectivity, so that we can deep dive into some of the solutions put in place to improve the overall player experience.\n\n### UNPLANNED MAJOR DOWNTIME  \n\nDowntime is likely to be the biggest concern for most players when it comes to connectivity. Downtime of a game's online services can have a wide array of causes, many of which are not linked to the game's servers themselves. Issues related to new features included as part of an update or the process and logistics behind patch deployment are just a couple of examples of triggers that could result in an online services outage. While our Connectivity team works to ensure our servers are ready for players at all times, we have multiple teams who are making improvements on their side too, with an aim to minimize these extra trigger sources as much as possible.\n\nBelow you will see the total unplanned major downtime for each month this year so far. We can see that while the most recent months of September and October have been a relative success, there are three main spikes throughout the year prior to this. Let’s inspect those spikes, why they occurred and how our teams responded.\n\n![[R6S] Classified: Connectivity 2023 - img V2](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/lOkeLV2qfvDeR0sHHUnRb/376e08c564de21f5fc8e73a5ffce7f8e/UnplannedDowntimeChart.v2.png)\n\n__JANUARY__\n\nJanuary saw 15 hours and 54 minutes of unplanned downtime with a number of unique causes being identified, part of which was related to the release of Crossplay. The Connectivity team worked through both December and January bringing stability to the game and establishing areas where revisions or improvements were required. Each instance of downtime was also independently investigated by our teams, with steps taken on how to avoid or mitigate the effects of similar issues in the future. Changes made as a result of the investigations have since helped to reduce impacts from similar events.\n\n__APRIL__\n\nIn April, we had 7 hours of unplanned outages across three separate incidents all again having a unique cause. In all cases, the Connectivity team was able to detect the point of failure which was causing players to be unable to connect, and was then able to make immediate or planned changes to our systems and procedures to remedy the issues going forward.\n\n__AUGUST__\n\nY8S3 Operation Heavy Mettle was released on August 29<sup>th</sup>, and with this we encountered a major outage with overall downtime totaling 17 hours and 49 minutes. In essence, this outage was caused by a specific group of conditions arising, which led to our services being unable to handle the high amount of players attempting to connect at season launch.\n\nTo alleviate the issue, the team [disabled systems](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1699467502332289494) that would deliver Rank information to players, while still allowing Rank calculations to take place in the background. This allowed players to connect, matchmake, and complete meaningful Ranked matches while the team continued their work to get the game services fully operational once more. The team was then able to reinstate the delivery of Rank information to the game once conditions were stable.\n\nIn response to this situation, teams were able to make both specific and systemic changes to help ensure that the same outcome would not be repeated under similar circumstances.\n\n### DDOS (Game server)\n\nWhen talking about game server DDOS, we're looking at DDOS that directly affects players as well as a group of matches hosted on the targeted game server. The team have previously implemented a feature to reduce the number of matches affected by these attacks, resulting in less players being ejected from matches. \n\nAlthough the team has made progress in this area this year, we know that players still experience some issues with this. We see your feedback; we want to share that our work continues in this area and that the team will be making further changes in the future to help improve this situation.\n\n### SERVER REGIONS & PING TESTING\n\nWhen a player boots up Siege, it checks to find the server which will provide the lowest ping based on the player's current location. This functionality has allowed us to run live tests using new data centers, while gathering performance data. These tests are helping us to understand how activating new locations can not only improve connectivity for certain communities, but also impact the experience of all the other players.\n\nDuring 2023, after such tests had been completed, the Connectivity team made two new server regions available (one for Korea and another one from Europe Central). We've found that these new locations have been a boost for many players, enabling them to play with decreased pings leading to an improved experience overall.\n\n__SERVER REGIONS - WHAT'S NEXT?__\n\nWe've got nothing final to announce regarding additional new server locations as of right now, though we can confirm that it's an area the Connectivity team is putting a lot of resources into. In the coming seasons, the team will be running new internal tests, and we'll share more updates on this as soon as results become available.\n\nIn addition to testing new server locations, the Connectivity team is also working on updating and evolving its tooling. This will allow the team to pull more detailed information regarding their usage and ultimately facilitate decision-making when it comes to deciding which regions could benefit from additional resources the most.\n\n### CROSSPLAY\n\nCrossplay was implemented back in December and has been one of the biggest online changes to come to Siege. The feature has been a great success, though it's important to highlight just how this affected our online services in the weeks following release. During this time, we did experience issues leading to downtime which ultimately stemmed from the Crossplay feature. These issues were due to the challenges of deploying such a game-changing feature, while ensuring that all of our systems were ready to provide a stable experience with this additional load. Crucially however, the team was able to ensure that the feature remained live, while bringing stability to the game's online services, providing a highly awaited change that many players had been asking for.\n\n### TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT\n\nOver the last few seasons, our teams have been working iteratively to replace older technology which is integral to our online services. Some of this technology has been in place since Siege's early development, and as the game continues to evolve, there is a need to ensure that we still have state-of-the-art systems in place. Once complete, our team and players alike will be looking to gain multiple advantages, including decreased maintenance downtime. \n\n### COLLABORATION\n\nAt Ubisoft we have a wide range of titles, each with their own Programming, Art, and of course, Connectivity teams. In the last year, our Connectivity team has found new ways to collaborate with such teams from other titles, including For Honor and Roller Champions. Since the new efforts were established, the data being shared has enabled us to mitigate online issues that might have otherwise affected players and has resulted in a significant positive impact overall.\n\n## LOOKING FORWARD\n\nThe team has made multiple learnings over past seasons and applied a number of changes while working on others which will be implemented in the future. While some of these changes only represent remedies for a fraction of causes, there is no doubt that the steps taken will be beneficial moving forward. \n\nTo sum-up, here's a look at some of the areas the Connectivity team is currently working on:\n\n- Putting strategies in place to minimize unplanned downtime.\n- Reducing the impact of game server DDOS.\n- Tightening collaboration with other titles including For Honor and Roller Champions.\n- Testing for possible new data centers.\n- Removal and replacement of old technologies used throughout the game's life.\n- And much more behind the scenes.\n\nThis is just a brief overview of what the Siege Connectivity team has been up to, we hope that this article provides useful insight into some of the topics that are being looked at. We want to add that this is only a snippet of what this team is working on, and we'll share more on this topic in the future.\n\nWe thank you for providing feedback on your online experience as it's extremely helpful to the team and we couldn't make improvements without you!","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","dev-blogs"],"readTime":8,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/3np0dmOyTZY3BVXe4qcRZQ/classified-connectivity","date":"2023-11-17T15:35:00.000Z"},{"id":"1BZt0t9asNHvdTBHU9OUGZ","title":"Y8S4 Designer's Notes","abstract":"In this latest edition of Designer’s Notes, we'll go into detail about the balancing changes that’ll come with the Y8S4 test server and give you some insight into the reasons behind them","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4OMngveP6mCNtRzteX20YT/133d5332d55a0eb5668e3e464cd76d6f/Y8S4_DesignersNotes_Header_960X540.jpg","content":"# BALANCING MATRIX AND TOP OPERATOR BANS\n\n## WIN DELTA VS.

Added fuse time reduction after the first bounce.\n- Initial fuse time: 4 seconds (from 5).\n- Reduced fuse time: 2 seconds.\n\nWe want to bring down the power level of the Frag Grenade to be in line with all the other Secondary Gadgets. Like all the others, it should be a weaker version of a Primary Gadget, such as the Hard Breach Charge for the Hard Breachers or the Bulletproof Camera for the Intel Gatherers. The secondary utility should not compete with or drive more attention than the main ability of an Operator. This change will put the spotlight back on Operators' abilities, and we will have more margin to make them excel in their roles.\n\nWe also want to increase the population of Frag Grenades, so more operators can get them without severely affecting their presence. We won't keep this utility as limited as it is right now forever because it conflicts with our intention to give as many options as possible to players to foster creativity.\n\nTo that end, we will remove the ability to cook grenades. This change removes a skill component when using them, but this aspect has been identified as the main reason why they are too powerful. Player ability can turn Frag Grenades into a better version of most operator abilities. Skilled players have reached a level that even ignores the correct counters for grenades, by killing defenders from below without warning.\n\nWe have not taken this decision lightly because of its impact on the skill ceiling when learning and mastering the use of Frag Grenades. We have adopted the fuse system from the Stun Grenade which means that the fuse time will be reduced to 2 seconds after the first Bounce (if the time is higher), so you'll still retain some control over the gadget. Reducing that skill ceiling is our last resort when tweaking a gadget, as we generally aim for the opposite.\n\nWe have tested multiple ideas looking for the right solution for the Frag Grenade's power level while keeping its identity intact. Here are a few of the changes we explored but ultimately did not implement:\n\n- __Damage through surfaces__: Here, we wanted to fix the competitive issue with a direct approach. We tested several options, from only reducing the damage below the lethal threshold to completely removing it along with the destruction. This solved the usage from the floor below against operators, but it didn't affect their power level for the majority of the population, so we wouldn't be able to give them to more operators.\n- __Non-lethal__: The most appealing aspect is the lethality, so we tried to reduce it directly. We tested reducing the base damage to non-lethal, so you'd have to land several Frag Grenades to kill your target. Not being able to guarantee the kill with a single throw achieved most of our objectives, but it also destroyed part of gadget's personality.\n- __Reduce amount__: We evaluated reducing the amount to only 1 per operator to see if it was enough to make the other options more appealing. Unfortunately, this change made them too binary; we only removed the ability to try again if you missed the target. If you were accurate, you could still achieve the same results, and this potential was deemed enough to favor selecting a single Frag Grenade over any other gadget.\n- __Random fuse time__: With this prototype, we tried to add a bit of uncertainty to discourage players from cooking the grenades too accurately. They are super dangerous, so it is not a device you should want around when the detonation mechanism is triggered. We changed the fuse time to be between 3 and 5 seconds. This version achieved several of our goals because the players weren't as accurate with them as they were with the live version and gave defenders time to react, which made them more interactive. But despite being a fun prototype, adding more randomness into the game while we are trying to remove it from other areas didn't convince us.\n\n## OPERATOR BALANCING\n\n### IQ\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades.\n\n#### 552 COMMANDO\n\n- Damage: 43hp (from 47).\n- Stronger vertical and horizontal recoil.\n\nFinally, IQ gets Frag Grenades back. We will see if she can keep them depending on the power level of the new version and how her having them affects other interactions in the game. She is an intel gatherer, and her intel can help attackers use resources and time more efficiently. We don't want her increased utility to overshadow the team play.\n\nWe love her relationship with the EMP Impact Grenade. Having her on the team avoids putting drones in danger or wasting EMPs trying to hit an electricity source. She can also help the team use anti-utility gadgets more efficiently by seeing which ones are protected. She can find electronic gadgets that are normally hard to locate and track enemies using them.\n\nBecause of the increased utility and versatility, we must reduce the 552 Commando's fire power. We will reduce its damage to make the Extended Barrel combo weaker. With the new damage, 1-armor operators will take 3 bullets instead of 2 to get downed. We've also made its recoil more challenging to control, which will bring it in line with other Assault Rifles.\n\nIQ is a team player. She helps the team be more efficient and is one of the best representations of the essence of Siege.\n\n### LION\n\n#### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades, Removed EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nLion and Frag Grenades were previously incompatible as the EE-ONE-D forces defenders to stay still giving the defender no options against a cooked grenade.\n\nWe are reconsidering his candidacy now because of the new synergy with the detonation system. The new Frag Grenade will force targets to move instead of killing them right away, pushing defenders into the EE-ONE-D's detection. The defender will have to think fast to evaluate the different options and decide the best course of action.\n\nWe are swapping them for the EMP Impact Grenades because they are the least picked option, and of course, removing the Gonne-6.\n\n### SENS\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Weapons: Removed Gonne-6.\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades.\n\nYou must master the R.O.U. Projector and the new Frag Grenade to make use of Sens' full potential. They have the ability to block multiple lines of sight, pressure enemies out of strong positions, and even force them to cross the light screens. This will increase Sens' skill ceiling even more.\n\nSens has a projectile as their main ability, and it goes against a rule we broke with Gridlock in Y8S3.3 (allowing both a throwable unique ability and Frag Grenades). We will test if this rule should remain in place with the updated Frag Grenade, or if it allows more flexibility with the distribution.\n\n### OSA\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades. Removed Smoke Grenades.\n\nThe new Frag Grenades will replace Osa's Smoke Grenades, as it was her least picked secondary gadget option (only 15% of the rounds).\n\nOsa allows attackers to create a setup, something that was exclusive for defenders until she arrived. She approaches the assault in a more methodical way, gaining terrain from defenders, but she cannot do it without help. This makes her a good candidate for this extra utility, as it is gameplay we want to encourage, but she still has good synergy with all the other secondary options, so we hope all of them will remain interesting.\n\n### BLACKBEARD\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added Frag Grenades. Removed EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nBlackbeard is the last attacker receiving Frag Grenades. His low presence made him an easy selection and since the Claymore is still a good option, we hope choosing between the two isn't easy or at least depends on the way you intend to play the round.\n\n### CAPITÃO\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added EMP Impact Grenades.\n\nWe have decided to give Capitão EMP Impact Grenades to compensate for their removal from other operators and make choosing between him and Osa a bit tougher. Having Hard Breach Charges and EMPs to choose from can allow him to fit into more attacking compositions.\n\n### GRIM\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Secondary Gadgets: Added EMP Impact Grenades. Removed Breach Charges.\n\n##### 552 COMMANDO\n\n- Damage: 43hp (from 47)\n- Stronger vertical and horizontal recoil.\n\nWe are pretty happy with the results of all of Grim's buffs. Unfortunately, he shares the 552 Commando with IQ, so the changes made to it will also affect him. To compensate for that, and recoup some of the EMP Impact Grenades removed, he will also get them, replacing the Breach Charges. We believe it is a fair exchange; losing some frag potential but gaining flexibility now with the Bailiff 410 for soft destruction.\n\n### MIRA\n\n##### BULLETPROOF GLASS\n\n- The bulletproof glass will be shattered if a Drilling Projectile explodes successfully after drilling into it.\n- This change affects all bulletproof glass: Black Mirror Window, Evil Eye, Talon Shield, Bulletproof Camera, Deployable Shield.\n\n##### ASH'S BREACHING ROUND\n\n- The Breaching Round is considered a Drilling Projectile.\n\n##### KALI'S V-LANCE\n\n- The V-Lance is considered a Drilling Projectile.\n- Note that the V-Lance doesn't drill through gadgets; it only drills through surfaces (the Black Mirror Window is considered part of the wall).\n\nMira is a game-changing operator. If you spot her during the Preparation Phase, you know that something will have to change in the way you execute the attack. We love the effect she has in game, but we believe the reason for her high ban rate is purely strategic. You don't want to deal with her in situations where she alone defines the pace of the round.\n\nWe introduced the Shattered Glass system back in Y6S3 to give attackers more ways to deal with the Black Mirror Windows and penalize bad usage. We are very happy with the results, so we are going to expand that system by adding new sources, so attackers have more flexibility when spotting a Mira.\n\nWe have defined a new projectile category; \"Drilling projectiles\". These projectiles drill into the surface they impact to apply their effect. They'll explode from the inside of the surface to deal more damage and will now shatter bulletproof glass. For instance, if Ash's Breaching Round sticks to the Black Mirror glass and explodes successfully, the glass will be shattered.\n\n### MAESTRO\n\n##### LOADOUT\n\n- Main Ability: 3 Evil Eyes (from 2)\n\n##### EVIL EYE\n\n- Battery: 6 seconds (from 5)\n- Overheat: 6 seconds (from 5)\n\nMaestro has been indirectly nerfed repeatedly since the release and introduction of new systems (Shattered Glass, Outside Cameras), new operators (Flores, Brava), new gadgets (Gonne-6, EMP Impact Grenades), and tweaks to operators (Dokkaebi) and now again with the increased population of Frag Grenades. Because of all this and the current meta, his presence has understandably gone down to be one of the least-picked defenders. \n\nThe changes to Evil Eyes should make attackers treat them with more respect. The new battery will allow Maestro to kill 1-armor operators with a single turret and down 2 to 3-armor operators. Increasing the number of Evil Eyes to 3 will increase his flexibility, requiring at least two operators with the proper secondary utility to deal with all of Maestro's utility, helping him become the master of intel that he should be.\n\n## PLAYLIST ECOSYSTEM CHANGES\n\n### QUICK MATCH AND STANDARD\n\nWe feel confident about the Quick Match changes introduced last season. The faster match time provides players a much faster paced experience. Attacker Vanguard allows players a safer approach to the action and Pre-Setups let defenders play fast without having to forfeit the strategic element of reinforcements.\n\nHaving said that, we are aware of the community's concerns regarding the new playlist ecosystem, and we realize that we made changes to the Standard mode before having the completed map pool available in Quick Match. Therefore, we are making the Standard map pool the same as Ranked while we dedicate our efforts to adding all the maps back to Quick Match as soon as possible. Once the map pool is completed, we will allocate some time to revisit Standard's map pool and provide more options for players to enjoy the maps that they want. We are working on a proposal to bring back player agency by allowing you to enjoy Standard's map pool with some control over it.\n\n##### QUICK MATCH MAP POOL UPDATE\n\n##### Added:\n\n- Hereford Base\n- Presidential Plane\n- Yacht\n- Fortress\n- Emerald Plains\n- Stadium\n- NightHaven\n- Lair\n\n##### STANDARD MAP POOL UPDATE\n\n- Oregon\n- Club House\n- Consulate\n- Bank\n- Kanal\n- Chalet\n- Kafe Dostoyevsky\n- Border\n- Skyscraper\n- Coastline\n- Themepark\n- Villa\n- Outback\n- Emerald Plains\n- NightHaven\n- Lair\n\n<hr>\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","patch-notes"],"readTime":12,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1BZt0t9asNHvdTBHU9OUGZ/y8s4-designers-notes","date":"2023-11-13T14:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"5BjYOwmKyyk6zwN6rwDxas","title":"“Acceptable casualties?

The new season is just around the corner, and there's no better time to introduce our newest Defense Operator Isaac \"Tubarão\" Nunes Oliviera. \n\nGrowing up in Ponta Delgada in Portugal, earthquakes and underwater eruptions were the norm. It taught Tubarão the value of mutual aid and community, making him a perfect fit for WOLFGUARD. He takes accountability for every life in his jurisdiction, and his teammates will be thankful for the freezing power of the ZOTO CANISTER. Not only can it slow opponents, the ZOTO CANISTER freezes electronic devices, and can even pause deployment for mechanical devices.  \n\nThe ZOTO CANISTER is a throwable device that can stick to any surface with a lot of utility. It can insulate metal from electricity, and even reveal footprints if the opponent walks on the frozen area. Attack Operators will want to wait for the freezing effect to dissipate before pushing in, but if you can't wait, Buck's SKELETON KEY or Sledge's TACTICAL BREACHING HAMMER can be reliable options against the ZOTO CANISTER. \n\nWith the NITRO CELL and PROXIMITY ALARM as secondary options, Tubarão focuses on utility denial making him a great operator for asymmetric strategies with focus on verticality. 2 HEALTH, 2 SPEED, and the AR-15 and MPX as primary weapon options and the P226 MK25 as his secondary weapon, denying breach from the attack is the foundation of Tubarão's gameplay. \n\nTubarão is driven by his unwavering dedication to civilian safety. During his time in the DAE, he would always ensure that civilians were insulated from hostile activity, going above and beyond what anyone else would do. His empathy and skills made him a high performing specialist, the perfect candidate to be recruited in to WOLFGUARD. \n\nTest out Tubarão and his chilling abilities on the Test Server starting November 13.","categories":["rainbow-six-siege","game-updates"],"readTime":2,"url":"https://ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5BjYOwmKyyk6zwN6rwDxas/acceptable-casualties-nah-tubaro","date":"2023-11-13T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"5elVeFwuDGjHBeNxPEoZNT","title":"Y8S3 MID-SEASON ROADMAP UPDATE","abstract":"Check out what's coming to Rainbow Six Siege in the Y8S3 Mid-Season Roadmap Update.","thumbnail":"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/cZJILTiwMxq1OTiDdGecH/fe73759c7f01910e802faf5426022bfc/Y8S3_Mid-Season_Update.960x540.png","content":"Every season when we roll out fresh content, we also provide an updated Roadmap to ensure transparency on upcoming features.

We have been building a new map on the foundation of verticality with carefully designed layouts and fresh avenues for strategic possibilities like never before! Make sure to watch the Y8S4 reveal panel to discover more!\n\n### [MAIN FEATURE] NEW VERSUS AI PLAYLIST\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nThis season will keep on delivering with the incorporation of a new versus AI Playlist tailored to let new players sharpen their skills against specially AI trained Defender bots to become the best operator they can be. Practice, strategize, and dominate like never before in this dynamic training environment. \n\n### [BALANCING] [BETA] REVAMPED SHIELD MECHANISM\n\n- __Status: BETA confirmed during Y8S4__\n\nShields have been part of Siege since the beginning and have sometimes seemed unbalanced with the current playstyles. As a game striving for tactical depth, we're committed to integrating shields seamlessly into gameplay without compromising immersion. We have been working on this strategy from the ground up, redesigning ballistic shields while retaining a unique playstyle which is both balanced and immersive. Brace yourselves for the first iteration of this revamped mechanism, available later during Y8S4 on the Lab TS. \n\n### [PLAYER COMFORT] CONTROLLER REMAPPING\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nWe are actively working on improving our players' comfort on consoles. In Y8S4, we will be providing an easy way to completely customize your controller inputs. This long-requested feature is dedicated to ensuring it answers all our console players' needs. Taking your feedback into account, we will also implement a new action to allow leaning while hip-firing on Consoles later in the season!\n\n### [BALANCING] [NEW] UPDATED FRAG GRENADES\n\n- __Status: Confirmed for Y8S4__\n\nAs announced in the last [Siege Classified: Balancing](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1694016584371634344?s=20), Frag Grenades have risen to an overpowered position in the current meta. They currently heavily influence Operator choices, tilting the balance between primary and secondary gadgets in an unbalanced way. With our commitment to providing the best FPS competitive experience, we have thoroughly examined Frag Grenades and rebalanced their impact to be more in line with all the other Secondary Gadgets. More information on this balancing change will be shared during the reveal panel, so everyone can have a blast playing Siege, so stay tuned!\n\n### [PLAYER PROTECTION] NEW RANKED REQUIREMENTS\n\n- __Status: Coming in Y9__\n\nRanked is the most popular competitive mode in Siege. Hence, it's no surprise that it's always in our line of sight in terms of priority, ensuring that players can enjoy a balanced competitive experience, both with and against similarly skilled players. We are committed to making sure Ranked is a fair environment and are adding more Ranked requirements to reinforce the core experience.\n\n### [PLAYER PROTECTION] PRIVACY MODE ON CONSOLES\n\n- __Status: Cancelled__\n\nThe work required to deliver Privacy Mode on consoles has brought up external challenges that came up late in the process. As well as this, new privacy features have been made available inside of the console ecosystem itself. For this reason, we've made the tough decision to stop the development of this feature on consoles specifically for the time being. \n\nAs you know, Player Protection remains a top priority, and we are committed to improving your experience and making Siege an even safer and fairer game to play on consoles.
