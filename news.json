These fresh new faces are chosen for their promising future in the Siege space.\n\nStay tuned! We will be revealing more details on this new seasonal charm and associated criteria toward the end of the first season.\n\n## Screening Procedure\n\nWe have implemented additional screening procedures into our selection process for streamer charms.\n\nUpon selection for the program, streamer charm candidates' main and alt accounts are now screened for MouseTrap violations, gameplay violations, and histories of toxicty, in addition to the other screening steps they undergo for eligibility.\n\n## How to acquire charms\n\nThese charms are only available by subscribing to the respective streamer's Twitch channel with a linked Ubisoft account. For more information on how to link your Ubisoft and Twitch account, as well as opt in for Twitch Drops, please refer to [this FAQ](https://support.ubi.com/Faqs/000035432/Get-your-Twitch-Streamer-s-charm).\n\n## How to get involved\n\nWe have updated the Ubisoft Creators Program registration to open the program to TikTok and Instagram, therefore opening new collaboration opportunities for content creators, streamers, fan artists, and cosplayers from our community.\n\nWe are always on the lookout for content creators that inspire and enrich the Siege community. If you would like access to the perks of being a partnered content creator, and your goal is to one day have a charm in the game, we would like to invite you to apply to the [Ubisoft Creators Program](https://creatorsprogram.ubisoft.com/en-us).\n\nFrom there, complete the following steps:\n\n1\\. Connect your Ubisoft Account. If you do not have one, you can create one [here](https://account.ubisoft.com/).\n\n2\\. Agree upon the eligibility criteria.\n\n3\\. Connect your primary channel (Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) or secondary channels.\n\n4\\. Indicate your games preferences.\n\n5\\. Set your location, broadcast language, and communication language.\n\nYour application will then be submitted and must be approved by Ubisoft. An email will be sent to confirm your participation.",

    "content": "# COMMUNITY PRIORITIES\n\nDuring the Munich Major, Game Director Joshua Mills delivered a message to the community with further updates on anti-cheat, balancing, ranked and content. You can find here an outline of these updates along with some of the actions we're taking to address these priority topics in follow-up to last month's blog post. \n\n## YEAR 11 CONTENT CADENCE PHILOSOPHY\n\nIn October's blog post, we briefly mentioned our plans to deliver bigger seasonal updates. Now we're excited to introduce the new Year 11 seasonal cadence. This is not the roadmap; it is our new approach to bringing you fresh gameplay starting next year.\n\n![[R6S] Y11 Seasonal Cadence Update - 1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2SCYaI34fTmmfPhawl8Lnh/8418adc6cb7d88a23e0781101465ffb0/Y11_seasonal_cadence.jpg)\n\nEach season will be split into four updates, with a new update every three weeks throughout the season. Four Balancing updates will be introduced per season to match the new cadence: Two Major and two Refined. We'll get into the details at the Six Invitational in Paris. Those updates will follow our new philosophy and keep the season evolving and exciting. You will also see changes with a rotation of maps in the Ranked pool. This will happen twice per season: once at launch, and once at midseason.\n\nWe will also be introducing a new concept of __targeted map adjustments__ midway through Year 11. These adjustments will be like miniature redesigns of a site on a Ranked map. Some doors are closed, windows are removed, or even walls relocated to completely challenge how that site is attacked and defended. We may even add an all-new objective site to the map. These adjustments will continue each season after they are introduced. In Y11, we will also be implementing the initial testing of 1v1 and 2v2 game modes. We will be using the arcade playlists to do this, but your participation will help determine if we grow it into something bigger!\n\n## ANTI-CHEAT\n\nCheating has no place in Rainbow Six Siege. The number of matches impacted by cheaters in the past month is trending in the right direction. We have not yet reached the target we have set for ourselves, but we are seeing real progress, which is encouraging.\n\nStarting in Y10S4, we will be doubling the deployment of anti-cheat updates per week, to make it harder for cheaters to even show up in the first place.\n\nAdditionally, the solutions we are reinforcing go beyond detection and bans; they are about prevention, meaning closing more access points for cheat makers, all while improving our tech.\n\n## BALANCING\n\nOur balancing philosophy is evolving with your feedback. The community has told us that balance should not come at the cost of fun, nor should it be all about nerfs - and we fully agree!\n\nFrom now on, our balancing team will focus every update on preserving the thrill and personality that make Siege special. Recent changes to Denari and Solis in the Y10S3.3 patch is one example of how we're actively making this shift.\n\n## RANKED\n\nComing soon with Y10S4, Ranked matchmaking will get smarter by considering your visible rank for tighter, fairer matches.\n\nWe are currently deep in development on a full Ranked Overhaul, which will launch Y11S2, and will introduce more transparency and visible skill tracking.\n\nAs part of this, we're introducing a new feature codenamed Top of the Ladder. Top of the Ladder is a new competitive playlist designed for the best of the best.\n\nTop of the Ladder will unlock at each midseason update starting Y11S2. One of the requirements to gain access to this next level competitive playlist is that you need to be Champion during the current season. This is a fully visible MMR competitive leaderboard for the best Siege players. You will see exactly where you stack up against your region and global standings. We will be actively monitoring and reviewing all players that enter this playlist to ensure and bad actors are stripped from the leaderboard.\n\nAdditionally, more aggressive security measures will be brought online when this playlist goes live to further secure it and maintain the competitive integrity.\n\nWe are still fine-tuning it with the help of community leaders, and we will be ready to share more about it at the Six Invitational in February. Just know that being Champion is one thing - staying on top is another level.\n\n# MOVING FORWARD\n\nAs we enter Y10S4, we want to be clear to all of you that the future of Siege is one where we are refocused on the CORE experience that truly defines Siege - with its community at heart. This is our legacy, and it is a story that we will continue to write together throughout Year 11 and beyond.\n\nThere is a lot more on Siege's horizon, and we are continuing our commitment to providing more frequent updates. You can also look forward to the Six Invitational in February, where we'll share the full Year 11 roadmap. You can follow Siege's social media channels for the latest news in the meantime.\n\nThank you so much for playing, and please continue to share your feedback so that we can make Siege the best tactical shooter in the world.\n\nOn behalf of everyone on the Siege team, happy 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary!\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rainbow6game), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).\n\n* * * * *",

Tweaking him individually has always been a challenge. A testament to this is that most of the changes he's undergone have come from modifying elements around him, such as the introduction of EMP Impact Grenades, or allowing Bandit to stack multiple batteries on a single wall.\n\nHis remaster is built on two key pillars: future-proofing Thatcher with new balancing levers, and raising his skill ceiling while maintaining the accessibility that made the old Thatcher so approachable for less experienced players.\n\nThatcher's new gadget is the E.G.S. Disruptor. Its core function remains the same: disabling enemy electronics - but it now introduces a layer of tactical depth. The E.G.S. is equipped with an electronic detection screen that allows Thatcher to scan his surroundings and aim the Disruptor Beam at selected gadgets. By default, gadget identities are hidden on the detection screen, but they can be revealed in two ways: by hitting them with the Disruptor Beam, or by pinging them (either by Thatcher himself, or a teammate). Once a device is hit, the screen displays how long it will remain disabled.\n\nThe E.G.S. Beam is a cylindrical volume of effect, 3.5 meters wide and 10 meters long (a shift from the old EMP Grenade's 5.2 meter spherical radius). The previous \"toss-and-forget\" approach offered limited room for creativity or player interaction. In contrast, the new gadget encourages players to explore enemy defenses, gather intel, and plan their approach, rewarding them with more strategic opportunities throughout the round.\n\nThatcher can still fulfill his traditional role, but now with added versatility. Imagine him roaming Clubhouse's rooftop, disabling Jäger's ADS units in Garage without exposing himself to throw an EMP, simply by scanning and aiming with the E.G.S.\n\nThe E.G.S. Disruptor introduces a suite of new balancing levers that allow for more precise tuning of Thatcher's impact in the future - from reload time, to beam range, to the available shots. These levers give us greater flexibility to respond to evolving metas and player feedback without needing to overhaul surrounding systems.\n\n### E.G.S. Disruptor\n\n- __Maximum resources:__ 6 charges\n- __Detection Range:__ 10 meters\n\n- __Beam Dimensions:__\n  - Width: 3.5 meters\n\n  - Length: 10 meters\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary weapons:__\n  - Added the PMR90A2\n\n## HIBANA\n\nHibana has a very tactical gadget that allows spending the right amount of resources for the right situation. However, it can leave her exposed for a long time, especially compared to her fellow hard breachers. The long range ability of the device is also among the unique perks of the X-Kairos; the addition of the PMR90A2 to her primary weapon loadout will allow players to dominate long ranges. We believe that with these changes, Hibana can better compete with Ace.\n\n### X-KAIROS\n\n- Removed the handle pump between shots\n- Reduced breaching time to 4 seconds (from 5 seconds)\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary weapons:__\n  - Added the PMR90A2\n\n- __Secondary gadgets:__\n  - Added Claymore\n\n## MAVERICK\n\nMaverick is currently very vulnerable when doing his best work. We have rearranged the resources in his main ability to make sure you can focus on cutting down walls and staying safe while doing so. We are also reintroducing frag grenades to the loadout. We believe this will increase the overall utility that Maverick can offer his team.\n\n### BREACHING TORCH\n\n- Canister content has been condensed into two canisters, limiting the amount of reloads needed when using the Breaching Torch. It is still the same amount of fuel, just in larger tanks now.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary weapons:__\n  - Added the Reaper MK2\n\n- __Secondary Gadgets:__\n  - Added frag grenades\n\n## THERMITE\n\nThermite is the hard breacher that must commit the most to do his job. Once he breaches, we want him to be able to deal as much damage as possible to the defending team. Additionally, we are adding a secondary shotgun to his loadout.\n\n### EXOTHERMIC CHARGE\n\n- Increased the amount of charges to 3 (from 2).\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__\n- Added ITA12s\n\n## ACE\n\nAce is the golden pick for hard breach. The changes we are making to his stats and kit will allow for more wiggle room and variety between hard breacher picks while still acknowledging Ace's flashiness.\n\nFollowing the changes for Hibana, Maverick, and Thermite, the goal is to make each hard breacher shine, avoiding ensuring that Ace is the best pick in every situation. We believe that this package will provide variety and more viable options in the field.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- Speed: Reduced to 1 (from 2).\n- Health: Increased to 3 (from 2).\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary gadgets:__\n  - Removed breach charges\n\n  - Added stun grenades\n\n## MUTE\n\nMute will be taken out of the DSEG effect. His effect will no longer be a permanent EMP around the jammers. Instead, it will affect gadgets that have signals coming in or out of the radius.\n\nFor example: Thermite will still not be able to trigger an exothermic charge inside the radius of one of Mute's jammers, but one of Ace's SELMAs will not be affected because it is automated.\n\nThis series of changes were made to make Mute easier to balance. As they exist right now, the zones of Mute's jammers cancel all electronics, leading to situations that were hard to grasp for everyone.\n\nThese changes will allow us to make Mute better against certain types of gadgets, while not affecting others. Since this will ultimately impact his gadget's performance, we revoked a previous nerf that was implemented when Mute was too dominant.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- Speed: Increased to 2 (from 1).\n- Health: Reduced to 2 (from 3).\n\n### SIGNAL DISRUPTOR\n\n- Jams wireless signals (instead of disabling electronic gadgets).\n- Range increased to 2.475 meters radius (from 2.225 meters).\n\n## CASTLE\n\nWe are adding a new interaction for Castle's barricades: Kaid's Electro-Claws will now be able to electrify them. Electrified Armor Panels will follow the same rules as Electrified Reinforcements; they will destroy electronics in contact with them (meaning that, for example, Fuze will not be able to deploy his gadget's charges without first dealing with the source of electricity).\n\n### ARMOR PANEL\n\n- Can be electrified by Kaid's Electroclaws\n\n## ARUNI\n\nCurrently, disabling a Surya Gate is less effective than overloading it, which we believe may lead to unintuitive gameplay. This behavior encourages players to use the disabling utility in a way that doesn't align with its intended purpose. With the updated flow, the gate will transition to an overloaded state after completing its disabled phase. This means that using the utility correctly will result in the gate remaining inactive for a longer duration, reinforcing its proper use.\n\n### SURIYA GATE\n\n- The gate switches to Overload state when the Disabled state finishes (instead of reverting to the previous state).\n\n## ASH\n\nAsh is a powerful operator for clearing enemy utility and creating soft destruction. Her Breaching Rounds deploy and trigger quickly, making counters against them mostly limited to utility catchers like Wamai's MAG-NET System, Jäger's ADS, or Aruni's Suriya Gates.\n\nTo increase counterplay, we're expanding her vulnerability list. Electricity is a natural fit. Making Breaching Rounds susceptible to electrified surfaces will add new layers of strategy. Electrified Deployable Shields, Castle Barricades, and Mira's Black Mirrors will now pose a greater challenge for Ash players.\n\n### BREACHING ROUNDS\n\n- Breaching rounds will be vulnerable to electricity\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n## DSEG\n\nWhile remastering Thatcher, we took some time to consolidate some behaviors tied to DSEG. DSEG is the effect caused by EMP Grenades, Thatcher's new E.G.S. Disruptor, and Bulletproof Cameras. These changes were made with rationalization and learnability in mind. It should be easier to understand what happens, and what you can and cannot do when affected with the DSEG affect.\n\n### CHANGES\n\n- All Sights, Scopes, and Optics are now affected by DSEG. Previously only 1x were affected.\n- You can reapply the affect to refresh the time disabled.\n- When a character is affected by DSEG, they can no longer trigger their remote devices (breach charges, Exothermic charges, Smoke's canisters, Cluster charges, etc.).\n\n## REINFORCEMENT\n\nThe current threshold for the amount of reinforcement needing to be cut down to cause it to crumble has been changed. You need to cut a full line in order to cause the reinforcement to detach from the wall. The goal of this change is to make it easier to understand on both sides what is going on with the reinforcement. This allows us to have more agency when balancing hard breachers and deciding how these reinforcements behave.\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n## PISTOLS\n\nThe ADS (aiming down sights) animation has been reworked. The gun now stands further away from the camera. This affects pistols and should provide more comfort when using these weapons.\n\n## PMR90A2\n\nThe PMR90A2 is a new marksman rifle that prioritizes high precision above all else. Its inclusion is meant to offer a long-ranged option for operators that previously lacked one, but who still might want to hang back and hold long angles to support their team. It has a bit less stopping power compared to some of its contemporaries, but it makes up for it with top notch accuracy. The PMR90A2 can still be used comfortably with a suppressor, meaning it can also be a potent choice for players who want to take a stealthy infiltration approach.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED:\n\n- Capitão\n- Hibana\n\n- Nøkk\n- Thatcher\n\n## TYPE-89\n\nHibana is receiving a new weapon and a lot of changes. To go along with these changes, we revisited the recoil of the Type-89. These changes should lead to a more comfortable experience using this weapon.\n\n### RECOIL ON PC AND CONSOLE\n\n- Horizontal:\n  - Reduced the recoil on all stages, making it easier to manage.\n\n- Additional 3 bullets required before hitting the worst part of the recoil (from 12 to 15).\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED:\n\n- Hibana\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n![[R6S] Y10S4 Designer's Notes - 1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6U7ecbV8N6thiBw8J2QOp9/b20c751093a4d3b6279a2b684daf5218/Y10S3_Rank_Distribution_PC.png)\n\n![[R6S] Y10S4 Designer's Notes - 2](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3ufLT1nMjbl8MZwYvvEZBL/8d281515efe483ea07fc1cd6323a7afc/Y10S3_Rank_Distribution_Console.png)\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).",

    "content": "The R6 ShieldGuard team is here to highlight the progress made this season, with some news on what's to come.\n\n## STATUS OVERVIEW\n\nCompetitive integrity is the foundation of Siege, and we've continued to listen to your concerns, and monitor your feedback. It's clear however, that cheating remains to be a core issue. We're committed to the betterment of Siege for all players, and although we have seen recent, minor improvements, it's important to note that this is part of a larger journey and vision.\n\nFirstly, we can confirm that we'll be doubling the cadence of R6 ShieldGuard updates in Season 4. Secondly, to help us develop the necessary improvements more quickly, we're working to share technology with partners across the industry. The R6 ShieldGuard team is also continuing to expand to accelerate future updates.\n\n## PLAN OF ACTION\n\n### MORE UPDATES IN SEASON 4\n\nFor multiple seasons now, we've been deploying R6 ShieldGuard updates with each patch and hotfix, but in Season 4 this will be changing. Starting next season, we'll be doubling how often these R6 ShieldGuard updates are pushed to the game, disrupting cheat makers more than ever before.\n\n### TARGETING HIGH PROFILE CHEATS\n\nOur team has targeted high profile cheat makers, and we are seeing results with these efforts. After recent updates were made, R6 ShieldGuard perma banned 1500 cheaters using high profile cheats, with an additional 2000 cheaters being perma banned while using a single notorious cheat product.\n\n### DISABLING CHEATS FOR LONGER\n\nThis season, we've been working to increase the impact we're having on cheat makers, keeping them offline for longer, and we've started to have more success in this area. This has resulted in us keeping select cheats offline for up to 5-7 days, up from 1 or 2 days previously. Our target is to carry this momentum forward, while we work to address the cheats that are disrupting legitimate players.\n\n## ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL CHEAT TYPES\n\n### ELO TRAPPING\n\nELO trapping is the act of intentionally matchmaking against known opponents who deliberately throw games to secure unfair wins and boost another account's ranking. A ban wave targeting ELO trappers was completed in October, with over 4300 cheaters being perma banned (including 36% of the top 100 console players). We will continuously ban any accounts related to ELO trapping.\n\n### BOTTING\n\nThis season we've seen bots infiltrating our less competitive game modes, mainly Team Deathmatch. We've perma banned over 6000 bots this season, and any accounts with suspicious botting activity will continue to be perma banned.\n\n### ANTI-RECOIL DETECTION\n\nWe've talked about our anti-recoil detection efforts before, and we want to confirm that it continues to be developed as part of R6 ShieldGuard. This is a complex, machine learning system which needs to train using high volumes of data. The system is currently in its data gathering phase behind the scenes, with further development and testing stages to follow.\n\n## PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 SHIELDGUARD\n\nHere are our updated perma ban figures covering the last 12 months, with new data for August, September and October. The total monthly perma bans issued has continued to increase from February, with ban waves being completed across multiple cheat types.\n\n![[R6S] Y10S3 R6 ShieldGuard Update - 1](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6rEGxorhS8v00SBYt05vqg/618c74cbe68cd485e710adb438147fd4/R6_BanChart_Nov24-Oct25_Y10S3.jpg)\n\n## HOW YOU CAN HELP\n\n### ACTIVATE TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATION\n\nKeeping your account secure helps keep the game fair for everyone. That's why we strongly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), especially using a mobile authenticator app if possible. By turning on 2FA, you're not just protecting your progress, you're helping us to fight cheating and keep the community safe.

    "content": "\n__The Siege Community Raises More Than $1 Million for Global Causes, Including $300,000 this year for Breast Cancer Research Through Sixth Guardian__\n\nWhen we first launched Sixth Guardian, we didn't know how far it would go, only that it mattered. What began as a small community project has grown into something much bigger: a global fundraising effort that's raised __over $1 million__ for different causes around the world.\n\nIn recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we're proud to share that since March 2024, the Sixth Guardian charity program has raised $300,000 in support of breast cancer research through our partnership with [__Worldwide Cancer Research__](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/)__,__ marking the largest fundraising campaign the Siege community has ever delivered.\n\nIt's time to reflect on what we've achieved together and more importantly, the real-world impact your support is making.\n\n__MISSION RECAP: WHAT IS SIXTH GUARDIAN?__\n\nSince 2020, Sixth Guardian has been Siege's way of turning our community passion into global impact, fundraising and partnering with organizations around the world to support causes that matter to our players: from mental health and environmental action to equity and accessibility.\n\nIn March 2024, we launched the __Azami__ __Sixth Guardian Hope__, a new chapter in partnership with [__Worldwide Cancer Research__](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/), focused on funding innovative __breast cancer research__.\n\n__SUPPORTING BREAST CANCER RESEARCH | WORLDWIDE CANCER RESEARCH__\n\nThis most recent campaign support __two high-risk, high-reward projects__ designed to tackle some of the toughest challenges in breast cancer treatment.\n\n__1\\. Nanoparticle 'Smart Bombs' to Target Metastatic Tumors__\n\n__Researcher__: Prof. Roberta Tasso, University of Genoa, Italy\\\n[Read more →](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/research-projects/developing-natural-nanoparticle-smart-bombs-to-target-hard-to-treat-tumours/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nMetastatic breast cancer, when the disease spreads to other parts of the body, remains the leading cause of breast cancer deaths. Treating it is notoriously difficult, as conventional drugs often fail to reach these distant tumor sites effectively.\n\nProf. Tasso's research focuses on engineering __natural extracellular vesicles (EVs)__, tiny particles that occur naturally in the body to act as \"smart bombs\" for delivering chemotherapy drugs directly to tumors. These EVs could offer a stealthy, targeted way to treat cancer, reducing collateral damage to healthy cells and overcoming drug resistance.\n\nIt's early-stage science, but it holds serious potential to transform how metastatic cancers are treated in the future.\n\n__2\\. Making targeted treatments work for more patients__\n\n__Researcher__: Prof. Pieter Eichhorn, Edith Cowan University, Australia\\\n[Read more →](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/research-projects/improving-the-effectiveness-of-a-breast-cancer-treatment-for-more-patients/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nSome breast cancer patients benefit from a targeted therapy that inhibits a molecule called __PI3K__, which helps cancer cells grow. However, for many patients, these treatments simply don't work and researchers still don't fully understand why.\n\nProf. Eichhorn's project investigates  why some cancer cells don't respond to this treatment, using  realistic \"mini tumours\" grown in the lab from patient cells. The goal is to identify ways to make these drugs more effective for more people, potentially opening up targeted treatment options for patients who currently have none.\n\n__Why This Matters__\n\nThese projects tackle areas of breast cancer research that often go underfunded due to their complexity and uncertainty. But these are exactly the kinds of risks that drive real breakthroughs.\n\nBy backing Worldwide Cancer Research through Sixth Guardian Hope, the Siege community helped launch projects that could reshape how breast cancer is treated especially for patients with advanced, resistant, or hard-to-treat forms of the disease.\n\nIn real terms, this means\n\n- Developing smarter ways to deliver chemo directly to tumors\n- Understanding and overcoming drug resistance\n- Expanding access to effective targeted therapies\n- Fueling the early science that leads to __future clinical breakthroughs__\n\nThe two research projects funded through Sixth Guardian Hope will unfold over the next __12-24 months__. Make sure to follow Worldwide Cancer Research to follow up on the progress made.\n\n__A NEW MILESTONE FOR SIXTH GUARDIAN__\n\nSixth Guardian has now raised more than $1 million since its creation in 2020, a testament to what this community is capable of both in-game and out in the real world.\n\nHere's what you've helped support so far.\n\n- __2020 (Y5S4)__ - [AbleGamers](https://ablegamers.org/): Combatting social isolation and improving quality of life for players with disabilities.\n- __2021 (Y6S2)__ - [Stack Up](https://www.stackup.org/): Supporting active and veteran service members through gaming and mental health programs.\n\n- __2021 (Y6S3)__ - [Indspire](https://indspire.ca/): Empowering Indigenous students across Canada to graduate and thrive.\n- __2022 (Y7S2)__ - [ILGA](https://ilga.org/): Defending the rights of LGBTQ+ people in more than 160 countries.\n\n- __2022 (Y7S4)__ - [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com/): Tackling the climate crisis through global reforestation and carbon reduction projects.\n- __2023-2024 (Y8S3)__ and __2025 (Y10S1)__ - [Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/): Funding game-changing research that could lead to future cancer cures.\n\nTime and again, you've answered the Sixth Guardian call. Whether you contributed directly or simply helped spread the word, you were part of something that made a difference. This won't be the last opportunity to make an impact, but for now, we wanted to take a moment to recognize your achievement.\n\nThe Siege community doesn't just breach walls, we break barriers.\n\nWe're proud to stand with you.\n\n__Thank you.__\n",

    "content": "\nSee the upcoming changes with the release of Y10S3.3.\n\n## BALANCING\n\n### JÄGER\n\nWe are boosting Jäger's secondary options by including a handgun with sights. This change should add versatility to the loadout and a more reliable mid-range secondary for players that want to use the M870 as primary weapon.\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n- Secondary weapons: \n    - Added the P-10C\n\n### BANDIT\n\nHitting exterior soft walls before reinforcing is a common tactic used to improve sound propagation, allowing defenders inside the objective to better anticipate enemy movements outside. Bandit has traditionally lacked a reliable secondary weapon to perform this kind of setup independently. With the introduction of the Keratos .357, Bandit gains the ability to create his own openings on exterior walls, enhancing his self-sufficiency during the preparation phase and reducing reliance on teammates for early-round destruction.\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n- Secondary weapons:\n    - Added Keratos .357\n\n### SOLIS\n\nSolis' use of her ability has not improved after the latest changes, players don't get enough benefit from it and we want to deal with this. We are reviewing her ability configuration and buffing a few parameters. The range of her ability will be increased along with its Overclock duration. We are also bringing the Impact Grenades back into her loadout to make her a more versatile roamer. \n\n__SPEC-IO__\n\n- Detection Range set to 20m (was 12m).\n- Overclock Duration set to 15s (was 10s).\n- Minimum SPEC-IO charge to activate the ability se to 25% (was 50%).\n\n__LOADOUT__\n\n- Gadgets: \n    - Added Impact Grenades and Removed Bullet Proof Camera.\n\n### DENARI\n\nAfter statistical analysis and player feedback on Denari, we've decided to revert some of the changes from previous patches. We can admit they may have been done too hastily, so we have reverted the damage change and reconnection delay. In addition, the Glaive-12 has not performed the way we expected, and it is receiving a package of buffs to make the weapon more viable in gunfights.\n\nWe've also taken in and understand feedback about its ability to create rotation holes feeling tedious. While slug shotguns can be used for rotation holes, the Glaive-12 primarily compliments Denari's T.R.I.P. connectors for precise lines of sight, foot holes and head holes.\n\n__T.R.I.P. CONNECTOR__\n\n- T.R.I.P. connector laser deals 20 damage.\n- T.R.I.P. connectors reconnect instantly after having their line of sight blocked.\n\n__GLAIVE-12__\n\n- Damage increased to 67 (was 63).\n- Damage range drop-off increased up to 15 meters to match other slug shotguns.\n- Improved recoil and first shot recoil (PC and Console).\n- Total ammunition increased to 44 (was 29).\n- Hip fire accuracy increased to match other slug shotguns.\n\n## BUG FIXES\n\n### OPERATORS\n\nFIXED - Alibi's Prisma prevents the formation of Denari's T.R.I.P. Connector laser network.\n\nFIXED - Goyo's Volcan Canister deploy animation doesn't display properly when in rappel.\n\nFIXED - Iana's Gemini Replicator is not affected by Denari's T.R.I.P. Connector laser network.\n\n### USER EXPERIENCE\n\nFIXED - Montagne's MTG MK.II portrait art is shown on top of the operator card thumbnail in the Appearance menu of the Operator Album.\n\nFIXED - Moderated voice chat transcripts aren't present for Playstation®5 consoles.\n\nFIXED - Door is missing from the tactical map during the deployment phase on the Bank map.\n\nFIXED - Player profile pictures don't load for each Squad during the Scouting Screen in Siege Cup.\n\nFIXED - Highlights are missing from the Overview section of the Esports menu.\n\nFIXED - Missing sound and voice effects after winning a match in the Siege Cup lobby.\n\nFIXED - The Mousetrap penalty duration shifts by one day on each subsequent boot after its initial display.\n\nFixed - Voice chat indicator is missing in Main Menu.\n\n---\n\nJoin the discussion on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rainbow6game/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/rainbow6), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Rainbow6/), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@rainbow6game).\n\nEncountering a bug?

We want to thank you all for your continued support while we work through these challenges, it means a lot.\n\n\\- Alex Karpazis and Joshua Mills, on behalf of the Siege team\n\n## ANTI-CHEAT \n\n__STATUS:__\n\nOur systems in *Siege X* did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress. This is a difficult topic to address without tipping off cheat makers to our next move, so without saying too much here are a few key areas the team is working to improve, backed by additional resources.\n\n__NEXT STEPS:__\n\n- Target high profile cheat makers and the use of a single notorious cheat product through advancements in Cheat Detection.\n\n- Disrupt marketplace exploits.\n\n- Issue permanent bans to players caught using these exploits.\n\n## BALANCING\n\n__STATUS:__\n\nWe've heard that updates can feel like all nerfs, no buffs, so we're changing up our approach when unexpected metas form and will prioritize a fun experience. We have high ambitions for larger system changes for the game's balancing, which will go into testing soon.\n\n__NEXT STEPS:__\n\n- In patch 3.3 (coming Oct 14) we'll be reverting Denari's nerf. We reacted a little too quickly on tuning him based on what we saw on the test server. Additionally, Denari's Glaive-12 will be buffed. \n- Solis will be receiving her impact grenades back to make her more fun to play. We can still see her influence in matches and how players use her shotgun for those post-plant situations.\n\n- For Y10S4, we can confirm that Thermite, Hibana and Maverick will all be receiving buffs. Ace will have a lot more competition! \n- Y10S4 will also introduce the Testing Grounds, a place to help us gather initial feedback and test implementation of gameplay features before they're integrated. An Armor and Speed system change for operators will be our first Testing Grounds subject. \n\n## RANKED\n\n__STATUS:__\n\nRanked 2.0 hasn't hit the mark yet and we're working on major changes. There will be matchmaking updates to start in Season 4 with more meaningful updates on the way.\n\n__NEXT STEPS:__\n\n- With Y10S4, matchmaking will get more specific with Rank and squad size factored in.\n- We are actively developing what we call Ranked Overhaul, with the objective of offering visible Ranked Reward Progression, as well as a visible Skill Progression.\n\n- Player consultations are in progress with this new system, and we'll be running workshops during the Munich Major to further refine the design.\n- We aim to have the Ranked Overhaul live in the first half of year 11. \n\n## FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWith much of this year's focus on setting a new foundation for updates to come, recent seasonal content has understandably felt lighter, especially for veteran players. We are looking at adjusting our seasonal approach to bring more substance to mid-season updates and we will share more on this topic during the November Munich Major.\n\nThis update isn't exhaustive, but expect to hear more from us, and please continue sharing your reports, feedback, survey responses and gameplay. Your passion and commitment keep Siege growing. Your priorities are our priorities, and together we'll keep building Siege into the best it can be.   \n\nWe look forward to celebrating our tenth anniversary together!\n\n*{-}7* \n\n*The Siege Team*",

These fresh new faces are chosen for their promising future in the Siege space.\n\nStay tuned! We will be revealing more details on this new seasonal charm and associated criteria toward the end of the first season.\n\n## Screening Procedure\n\nWe have implemented additional screening procedures into our selection process for streamer charms.\n\nUpon selection for the program, streamer charm candidates' main and alt accounts are now screened for MouseTrap violations, gameplay violations, and histories of toxicty, in addition to the other screening steps they undergo for eligibility.\n\n## How to acquire charms\n\nThese charms are only available by subscribing to the respective streamer's Twitch channel with a linked Ubisoft account. For more information on how to link your Ubisoft and Twitch account, as well as opt in for Twitch Drops, please refer to [this FAQ](https://support.ubi.com/Faqs/000035432/Get-your-Twitch-Streamer-s-charm).\n\n## How to get involved\n\nWe have updated the Ubisoft Creators Program registration to open the program to TikTok and Instagram, therefore opening new collaboration opportunities for content creators, streamers, fan artists, and cosplayers from our community.\n\nWe are always on the lookout for content creators that inspire and enrich the Siege community. If you would like access to the perks of being a partnered content creator, and your goal is to one day have a charm in the game, we would like to invite you to apply to the [Ubisoft Creators Program](https://creatorsprogram.ubisoft.com/en-us).\n\nFrom there, complete the following steps:\n\n1.

Blackbeard's abilities and loadout make him a very versatile pick that holds great offensive capabilities. In this patch we would like to keep his versatility while slightly reducing his offensive capabilities.\n\nThe first group of changes attend to Blackbeard's Aim Down Sight (ADS) mechanics. He will be slower to leave ADS, making him more vulnerable in that state. He also won't be able to ADS while rappelling in through a window.\n\nThe second group of changes are related to Blackbeard's Weapon Reloads. Now the H.U.L.L Shield will fold completely during the reloads, exposing most of Blackbeard's body to the enemies. The MK-17 will also see its magazine capacity reduced from 25 to 20. This should make Blackbeard reload more often and with higher risk.\n\nThe third group of changes aim to make Blackbeard a bit slower. While on rappel he won't be able to Breach In through non-weakened barricades, and we've also reduced his H.U.L.L Shield Breach Charges to from 4 to 3.\n\n### H.U.L.L. ADAPTABLE SHIELD\n\n- ADS Changes\n  - Blackbeard ADS recovery time set to 0.9s (was 0.5s).\n  - Blackbeard can't ADS while rappelling in a window.\n- Reload Changes\n  - Blackbeard's H.U.L.L. Shield completely folds while reloading.\n- Mobility Changes\n  - Blackbeard cannot breach-in from rappel through non-weakened barricades.\n  - H.U.L.L. Shield Breach Charges reduced to 3 (was 4).\n\n## ECHO\n\nEcho is losing the Magnified Sight on his MP5SD; he will no be more inclined to take fights at closer range and we ant to boost his mobility to make repositioning easier for him.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Speed:__ Increased to 2 (from 1).\n- __Health:__ Reduced to 2 (from 3).\n\n## FENRIR\n\nFenrir's ability has a high impact on Attackers. Since the last changes we made to him, it is easier to counter his traps, but we still consider his ability to be quite strong. We want to make the full Fenrir package a bit leaner by removing some of the extra utility that the Bailiff brings to the table. Players will need to rely on other defenders to set up the site.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Removed Bailiff 410.\n\n## LESION\n\nLesion has become one of the most reliable roamers. The combination of a great loadout, plus an ability that is useful for gathering intel and slowing enemies makes him a great option. The removal of the Magnified Sights on some Operators will make him more relevant. We are removing Lesion's shotgun to increase Lesion's focus on his ability, inviting Defenders to source destruction capabilities on the team from other loadouts.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Removed Super Shorty.\n\n## ORYX\n\nOryx's playstyle relies on mobility and quick reactions. A machine pistol provides high firepower and a quicker ADS compared to a submachine gun, allowing him to stay agile and effective in mid-range engagements. However, he will need to make more strategic decisions based on the situation, as selecting the Reaper MK2 without the SPAS-12 will leave him without the tools to destroy hatches. We believe that this addition will make him more adaptable and capable of handling a variety of combat situations while increasing the loadout variety.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapons:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## PULSE\n\nPulse greatly benefits from using the M1014, but the lack of a reliable secondary weapon limits its use in various situations. Since the recent improvements to shotguns, which significantly reduced the M1014's visual recoil for better comfort, its pick rate has stabilized at 29%. However, we believe that this rate is still below its potential, given its synergy with the Cardiac Sensor.\n\nBy introducing the Reaper MK2, we aim to provide Pulse with greater flexibility and ensure he doesn't feel powerless when opting to use the shotgun. Additionally, we believe that every weapon in his loadout has its own playstyle and fulfills different needs. The UMP45 will remain the most reliable option for long to mid-range engagements, while the M1014 and Reaper MK2 combination may be more appealing to mid to close-range play. And, of course, the handguns are always a reliable choice in any situation.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## ROOK\n\nRook's capability to hold long angles will be reduced due to the removal of Magnified Sights from his loadout. To reinforce his anchor role, we would like to add an alternative side weapon and gadget: the Reaper MK2 and C4. Both elements should reinforce his strength on close and mid-range engagements.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n- __Gadgets:__ Removed Observation Blocker. Added Nitro Cell.\n\n## SENTRY\n\nSentry is designed to fill any gaps in the defensive setup. However, with the current loadout he struggles to hold long angles comfortably. Therefore, we have decided to add a Slug Shotgun to his loadout. This addition will enhance his capability in long-range engagements while assisting with site setup.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary Weapon:__ Added TCSG12.\n\n## SLEDGE\n\nThe Reaper MK2 is less lethal than other Machine Pistols in the game, and that makes it suitable for a wider group of Operators. The addition of the Reaper MK2 will give Sledge a secondary weapon alternative that works good at close ranges.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n## STRIKER\n\nWe believe that Striker also deserves a weapon more suited for long-range engagements. The DMR will enable her to better support her teammates from a distance, and may synergize more effectively with other types of secondary utility.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Primary Weapon:__ Added SR-25.\n\n## WAMAI\n\nWe've removed a few secondary destruction tools in this patch (Lesion's and Fenrir's), but we don't want to affect the overall destruction capability of defenders too much. For this reason, Wamai will receive the Super Shorty, which will improve his usefulness during the preparation phase.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Super Shorty.\n\n## YING\n\nThe SIX12 is highly effective at close range but is not reliable at medium to long distances. The Reaper MK2 will provide a versatile secondary option, allowing her to engage enemies effectively at various ranges and creating more opportunities to use the shotgun in close-quarters combat. She can also use the shotgun for breaching and verticality, creating more opportunities to use the Candelas from above or from unexpected angles.\n\n### LOADOUT\n\n- __Secondary Weapon:__ Added Reaper MK2.\n\n# GADGET BALANCING\n\n## DEPLOYABLE SHIELD\n\nThis change is a small quality of life improvement. In some situations, a direct source of light generates a strong glare on the shield glass windows that prevents a clear view through them. We've improved the glass materials to ensure that the glass pieces do not generate glare in these situations.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Glass:__ Light reflections reduced for better comfort\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Echo\n- Ela\n- Frost\n- Pulse\n- Sentry\n- Tachanka\n- Thorn\n- Thunderbird\n- Warden\n\n# WEAPON BALANCING\n\n## SIGHTS\n\nMagnified Sights on Defensive Operators has a huge impact on their presence and on their killing potential. This update will limit defenders' access to these sights on automatic weapons. We still believe that defenders should be able to hold long angles and challenge attackers, but in a more limited way. Slug Shotguns and DMRs will still have access to Magnified Sights on Defense.\n\nAlso in this patch, you will find that some of the affected Operators have received tweaks to compensate for these changes, but more may come in the future. We will keep a close eye on the effect of these changes and will take action if needed.\n\n### MAGNIFIED\n\n- Automatic weapons on Defense do not have access to these scopes.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Castle\n- Doc\n- Echo\n- Frost\n- Goyo\n- Rook\n- Tachanka\n\n## BALLISTIC SHIELD\n\nShielded Operators will experience a slight exposure when throwing a projectile from behind the shield. Although this opening is smaller than it was with original shields, the momentary exposure creates a vulnerability that defenders can exploit, making it riskier for shielded operators to throw projectiles.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Projectile Throw:__ Animation added.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blackbeard\n- Blitz\n- Fuze\n- Montagne\n\n## MK17 CQB\n\nAs part of Blackbeard's balancing wave, we are tweaking his most used weapon. We are reducing its magazine capacity to make players more thoughtful when shooting. This should reduce the use of long pre-fires and make Blackbeard reload more often.\n\n### BASE STATS\n\n- __Magazine:__ Reduced to 20 (was 25)\n- __Max Ammunition:__ Reduced to 221 (was 226)\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Blackbeard\n\n## REAPER MK2\n\nThe Reaper is being issued to a few more Operators, and we want to take this opportunity to make its recoil a bit more comfortable. This weapon aims to be a bit different to other Machine Pistols in the game, and we want to keep that spirit. The initial rounds of the shot will be easier to handle, but sustained bursts will remain challenging to control. Using the weapon in short bursts will be more rewarding and successful for players.\n\n### RECOIL - PC\n\n- __First Shot:__ Reduced weapon initial kick.\n- __Horizontal:__ Softened lateral recoil on first stages.\n\n### OPERATORS AFFECTED\n\n- Oryx\n- Pulse\n- Rauora\n- Rook\n- Sledge\n- Ying\n\n# RANK DISTRIBUTION\n\n![[R6S] Y10S3 Designer's Notes Y10S2 Rank Distribution PC](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1Nkufc8i5QrgzsInIJuxJb/54fd331e50e890d6a49604d407fafcad/Y10S2_Rank_Distribution_PC.png)\n\n![[R6S] Y10S3 Designer's Notes Y10S2 Rank Distribution Console](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2nATjELyMG7JkObhN6jA0I/3a63939ece6790e8b6cabb3f6bd153b4/Y10S2_Rank_Distribution_Console.png)\n\nFollow us and share your feedback on [X](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/).",

    "content": "In our latest R6 ShieldGuard and Anti-Toxicity update, our teams will unveil key insights into Y10S2, along with actionable plans for both the current season and what's ahead.\n\n## IN THIS UPDATE\n\n__R6 SHIELDGUARD__\n\n- Status Overview\n- Exploits\n- R6 ShieldGuard Security\n- Live Security Updates\n- Account Related Bans\n\n__ANTI-TOXICITY__\n\n- Standing Distribution Update\n- Reputation System Sanctions\n- Text and Voice Chat Moderation\n- Abandonment Penalties\n- Privacy Settings\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - shield-guard](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/4ElOUUm1IQwUb7UBuZgtXn/11cabdfafb627651a308cb6e0d4b8c9c/Header_ShieldGuard_150x960_Y10S2.png)\n\nThe R6 ShieldGuard team is here to give an update on Anti-Cheat in Siege X. Today we'll look at the status since the release of Siege X and R6 ShieldGuard, and cover what's coming in the future. Check out the team's plans below.\n\n## STATUS OVERVIEW\n\nSince the launch of Siege X, it's clear that there has been a surge in cheater reports. The share of matches featuring players who receive 4 or more cheater reports within that single game has risen from an average of 1.8% to 2.5%. This spike is tied to the evolution of in-game exploits and the ongoing development of cheat programs. We know the impact that this has had on the enjoyment of the game for many and we are very actively working on solutions.\n\nWe've deployed several fixes since launch, though some of the improvements needed to strengthen R6 ShieldGuard will require longer-term development. Our goal is to make meaningful progress throughout Season 3 and beyond, ensuring we protect the game's integrity and improve your overall experience.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - impact](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2syXTDSCsyA9sPhJyEWJrr/130c22ca28af5a36504e18515d4c091d/R6_CheaterReportChart_Y10S2-960x540.jpg)\n\n## EXPLOITS\n\nWith the release of Siege X and the increased number of players, bugs were found in the game that could be used to gain an unfair advantage over other teams and players. These exploits are also a form of cheating.\n\nWith the help of our community, we've been able to address several major exploits as part of our most recent patches,including multiple teleportation glitches, legitimate external overlay applications providing an unfair visual advantage, impossible defusing spots or impossible use of weapons and gadgets, and crashes caused by specific operators. We have also identified and are actively fixing additional issues, with updates rolling out as soon as they're ready.\n\nWe want to sincerely thank everyone who has contributed - content creators, players, and those who have submitted reports via R6Fix. Your input has been crucial in helping us reproduce and resolve many of these exploits. To further prevent new exploits, we're working on a global solution that includes stricter tolerances in given situations to prevent similar exploits. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n## R6 SHIELDGUARD SECURITY\n\nThroughout Operation Daybreak, we have deployed several updates to our underlying in-house obfuscation technology which hides and protects game code. These updates are strengthening our defenses, and while we're already seeing some positive trends, more updates will be coming with every patch and hotfix. We're also constantly investing in reducing and stopping new gameplay violations, while improving our detections, targeting specific cheat features and providers.\n\n## LIVE SECURITY UPDATES\n\nYou may have noticed that Siege X occasionally requires a game restart and update. This is part of a new prevention system which has strengthened our anti-cheat defenses overall. While the system has been effective, we've identified bugs that have caused some players to be disconnected from matches or unable to reconnect. We understand how frustrating this can be and sincerely apologize for the disruption. Our team is actively working to resolve these issues so that players can benefit from enhanced protection without any unintended side effects.\n\n## ACCOUNT RELATED BANS\n\nWe're actively developing new tools that detect accounts linked to previously banned cheaters. If a banned player attempts to return, they're flagged and removed as soon as suspicious behavior is detected. In addition, we're working on systems to hold players accountable if they knowingly squad up with cheaters. This is part of our broader effort to protect the integrity of the game at every level.\n\n## PERMA-BAN NUMBERS - BATTLEYE + R6 SHIELDGUARD\n\nCheck out the last 12 months of perma-ban data, including new data for April to July. We can see here that the number of monthly bans has remained steady since the launch of Operation Prep Phase, with over 11,000 permanent bans issued on average per month. With a rise in cheaters being felt during the month of July however, investigation were started into whether our systems were still banning with the same effectiveness as previous months. This investigation led to adjustments being made to R6 ShieldGuard, which resulted in an additional ban wave being completed in early August.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - battleye](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6Z47X7rE81nx97K6phvWy1/ce0996775fe6dbfc6af849c320dd390b/R6_BanChart_Aug24-July25_Y10S2.jpg)\n\n## HOW YOU CAN HELP\n\n### ACTIVATE TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATION\n\nKeeping your account secure helps keep the game fair for everyone. That's why we strongly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), especially using a mobile authenticator app if possible. By turning on 2FA, you're not just protecting your progress, you're helping us to fight cheating and keep the community safe. For more information on 2FA, check our [self-help article](https://www.ubisoft.com/help/account/article/000065723).\n\n### REPORTING\n\nIn-game reporting continues to be the best way to get your reports to us, helping us to identify potential cheaters and take action.\n\nYour in-game reports help by:\n- Feeding our automated systems while combining with additional information.\n- Aiding the manual review process allowing cross reference for specific actions.\n- Providing an understanding of player perception on the current state of cheating at a global scale.\n\n## FINAL NOTE\n\nProtecting the game from cheaters and exploit abusers remains one of our top priorities.\n\nThroughout July, the team has consistently delivered fixes and improvements. In order to release stable solutions, some of the fixes may take more time, but our commitment to act quickly and effectively when issues arise continues. Elements of our future R6 ShieldGuard updates are also already underway, with more to be revealed soon.\n\nWe're not slowing down. Our focus is clear: keep Siege X fair, secure, and fun for everyone.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - toxicity](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/31p8jP1TStXmSZQRF5Dxkg/320bafee070f50e70d249b6b4cd45151/Header_AntiToxicity_150x960_Y10S2.png)\n\nThe Anti-Toxicity team is here to share a look at how the Reputation System has been performing in the time since its full rollout. Right now, the system is helping to shape a healthier, more respectful Siege experience and in this update, we'll share highlights on key features, ongoing improvements, and what's next.\n\n## REPUTATION SYSTEM\n\n### STANDING DISTRIBUTION UPDATE\n\nThe Reputation System was released from Beta in Y10S1, and this means that we now have more data than ever on its impact on players. Since its full activation, the amount of Dishonorable and Disruptive players has dropped by 81% and 54% respectively. Conversely, the number of players in Exemplary has increased by 114% with Esteemed increasing by 45%. It's clear that players have been adapting their behavior and rising to higher Reputation Standings, in turn making the game better for everyone.\n\n__STANDINGS - Y9S4 to Y10S2__\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - standings](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5rokWTq6MOOarbm4vqhr7Q/599fe0fe1e420ca92a31543d81f308f2/R6_AllStandings_Y9S4-Y10S2_Vert.v3.jpg)\n\n### DISRUPTIVE COMMUNICATION\n\nOur Anti-Toxicity systems are scaling with Siege X and continue to protect players from disruptive behaviors. We are now seeing a reduction of communication reports per match, with a -14% for Textchat and -27% for Voice Chat. This is also partly thanks to the new Chat Wheel, which allows players to communicate quickly and easily without friction. We can see below that exposure to negative actions dropped significantly with the release of Siege X.\n\n![[R6S] R6 Shieldguard & Anti-Toxicity - Y10S2 Update - communication](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7m8OTw1bC8NwRuwmbGKoFw/10296dbf88be4a694b180987b4acd53d/R6_FlagExposure.jpg)\n\n### REPUTATION SYSTEM SANCTIONS\n\nSince March 2025, we have temporarily banned over 4600 players who had completed an excessive amount of negative actions, accruing a critical number of negative Reputation Units. We can share that these temporary bans have worked well however, with 3 of 5 players adapting their behavior and not going on to offend again\n\n### DUAL FRONT ACTIVATION\n\nThe Reputation System is now active in Dual Front and positive and negative actions completed in this mode now impact your Reputation. Dual Front initially released without integration into the Reputation System, though thanks to your feedback, we were able to adapt our plans and bring the activation forward.\n\n## COMMUNICATION MODERATION\n\n### TEXTCHAT\n\nTextchat Moderation went live in December 2024, and since then we've worked to ensure the feature evolved with player feedback. The system is now working well, though we are aware that false detections can sometimes occur, often due to lack of context in a conversation.\n\nFrom Y10S3 we will be implementing functionality which will enable players with a Reputation Standing of Respectable and above to report detections which they believe to be incorrectly flagged. This, as well as our ongoing behind-the-scenes updates, will help to fine tune the system, reducing the chances of your messages being falsely flagged.\n\n### VOICE CHAT\n\nIn Y10S3 we will be introducing the next step of chat moderation in Siege in the form of Voice Chat moderation. With this addition, players flagged by the system will receive a warning and be subsequently muted if flagged again. In more extreme cases, offenders may find themselves being muted immediately and without warning. In all cases, any flags will carry a Reputation Standing impact, though as with Textchat, players with a positive standing will be able to report false voice communication flags.\n\nWe'll be utilising our experience with the Text Chat Moderation feature to bring balance to this new system. And, as we did with Text Chat Moderation, we'll be giving this feature close attention, ensuring that any false flags can be learned from with changes made to the system quickly.\n\n## ABANDONMENT PENALTIES\n\nAbandonment penalties, although necessary, can be a source of great frustration for those who receive them unfairly. This season we've already lessened the length of penalties, though there is more to come. We are actively working to implement a system that will target repetitive patterns over a longer period and subsequently enable us to reduce frustration for others.\n\n## PRIVACY SETTINGS\n\nPrivacy Mode is making its way to console in Y10S3. With this release, we'll be making some important updates to Privacy Mode across all platforms. Starting next season, nicknames will be auto assigned, removing the possibility of bad actors creating toxic usernames.All players will also have their nicknames removed at the end of a match, revealing their true usernames.\n\n## FINAL NOTE\n\nWe are very proud of the evolution that we’ve made with your feedback, together fostering a more positive environment. The Reputation System is working well in Siege X, helping to protect new and current players. We are devoted to our goal of making Siege a fun and safe game for everyone, and our work will continue through Y10S3 and beyond.\n\nYour feedback and support will always be key. Stay positive and let’s continue to make the game better!  \n\n---\n\n## OPERATION HIGH STAKES FULL REVEAL\n\nStay tuned for the *Operation High Stakes* full reveal, happening on __Sunday, August 17th at 10AM PT / 1PM ET / 7PM CET__ on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/)and[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6).\n\nWe'll also share __additional updates__ on the __R6 ShieldGuard & Anti-Toxicity__ systems, giving you a first look at __what's coming in the new season,__ so don't miss it!",
